When I was 11 , I remember w@@ aking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to B@@ BC News on his small , gray radio .
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
&quot; &quot; The Tali@@ ban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the Tali@@ ban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to es@@ cor@@ t my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
We would cover our books in gro@@ cer@@ y bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ acked in one small living room .
It was co@@ zy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because Tali@@ ban were susp@@ icious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pr@@ ized and daughters were tre@@ a@@ su@@ red .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total m@@ aver@@ ick from a remote prov@@ ince of Afghanistan , he ins@@ isted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ owned by his father .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She reti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Tali@@ ban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educ@@ ating his children .
During Tali@@ ban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; L@@ isten , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fe@@ es , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Fe@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mid@@ d@@ le@@ bur@@ y College .
( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one ex@@ iled from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his daughters , was among the first to con@@ grat@@ ulate me .
He not only br@@ ags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l .
( Applause ) My family believ@@ es in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global ambass@@ ad@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to educ@@ ate women .
That &apos;s why I co@@ founded S@@ O@@ LA , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ ky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition gr@@ abb@@ ing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advoc@@ ate for them , despite and even in the face of d@@ aun@@ ting opposition .
Like Ah@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ah@@ med is the father of one of my students .
L@@ ess than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ LA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a ro@@ ad@@ side bomb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recogni@@ zes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convinc@@ ing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Un@@ der the Tali@@ ban , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the frag@@ ility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. tro@@ ops &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advoc@@ ate for them , who encourage them , I see a prom@@ ising future and las@@ ting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and b@@ ound@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ LA remind me of that .
Like me , they are dre@@ aming big .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And you &apos;ll now see the y@@ ol@@ k and the white have separated .
And slightly more complex things appear .
That &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
And deep bene@@ ath those oceans , at cr@@ acks in the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , you &apos;ve got heat see@@ ping up from inside the Earth , and you &apos;ve got a great diversity of elements .
But of course , life is more than just exo@@ tic chemistry .
Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other — Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential net@@ working opportunity ?
We do this little interro@@ gation when we meet people to make a mental res@@ u@@ me for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divor@@ c@@ ed ?
Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answer@@ ing my interro@@ gation right now ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
We are neuro@@ log@@ ically hard@@ wired to seek out people like ourselves .
We start forming cli@@ ques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what accep@@ tance feels like .
We bond together based on anything that we can — music pre@@ ference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
We seek out environments that rein@@ force our personal choices .
Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; &quot; what do you do ? &quot; &quot; can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squ@@ ee@@ ze yourself inside of it .
Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too lim@@ iting .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
So here &apos;s a dis@@ cl@@ aimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
I grew up in a very shel@@ tered environment .
I was raised in down@@ town Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the e@@ pic@@ enter of pun@@ k music .
I was shi@@ el@@ ded from the p@@ ains of bi@@ got@@ ry and the social restric@@ tions of a religi@@ ous@@ ly@@ -@@ based up@@ bringing .
Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a dra@@ g qu@@ een or a radical thin@@ ker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the we@@ ir@@ do .
( Laughter ) It was an un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x up@@ bringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instinc@@ ts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basket@@ ball with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
So I went home , and I sh@@ av@@ ed my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot; &quot; I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
I kept up the char@@ ade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was playing a kid named Wal@@ ter in a movie called &quot; &quot; Juli@@ an P@@ o . &quot; &quot; I was a little street tough that followed Christian S@@ later around and bad@@ ger@@ ed him .
See , I was also a child actor , which doubl@@ ed up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl — not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the direc@@ tors that I worked with .
K@@ ids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the thro@@ at to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my cr@@ ot@@ ch to check what I was working with .
When I would go to the bath@@ room , I would turn my shoes around in the st@@ alls so that it looked like I was pe@@ eing standing up .
At sle@@ e@@ po@@ vers I would have pan@@ ic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to k@@ iss me without ou@@ ting myself .
It &apos;s worth menti@@ oning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my gen@@ it@@ alia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was performing this el@@ abor@@ ate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have quali@@ fied as trans@@ gender .
If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dys@@ morph@@ ic and put me on hormones to st@@ ave off pu@@ ber@@ ty .
But in my particular case , I just w@@ oke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
Pu@@ ber@@ ty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
When a kid behav@@ es like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
No one is exactly shoc@@ ked .
( Laughter ) But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fall@@ en in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents bat@@ ted an ey@@ el@@ ash either .
See , it &apos;s one of the great bless@@ ings of my very un@@ or@@ tho@@ do@@ x childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
So four , almost five years ago , Pro@@ position 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tar@@ n@@ ished civil rights record , could be repe@@ ating its mistakes so bl@@ at@@ antly .
And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separ@@ ation of church and state was essentially drawing ge@@ ograph@@ ical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
And then , that this discussion was drawing ge@@ ograph@@ ical boundaries around me .
If this was a war with two dispar@@ ate sides , I , by def@@ ault , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this ei@@ ght-@@ year personal identity crisis z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag that saw me go from being a boy to being this aw@@ k@@ ward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super sk@@ imp@@ y , over@@ -@@ com@@ pens@@ ating , bo@@ y-@@ ch@@ asing gir@@ ly@@ -@@ girl to finally just a h@@ es@@ itant exploration of what I actually was , a tom@@ boy@@ ish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
I had spent a year photograph@@ ing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of bet@@ we@@ en-@@ the-@@ lines — girls who sk@@ at@@ e@@ bo@@ ar@@ ded but did it in l@@ acy under@@ wear , girls who had boys &apos; h@@ air@@ cuts but w@@ ore gir@@ ly n@@ ail pol@@ ish , girls who had ey@@ es@@ h@@ ado@@ w to match their scr@@ ap@@ ed kne@@ es , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all h@@ ated being box@@ ed in to anything .
I loved these people , and I admi@@ red their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our u@@ top@@ ian bubble explo@@ ded into these r@@ aging deb@@ ates where pun@@ dits started lik@@ ening our love to bes@@ ti@@ ality on national television .
And this powerful awareness rol@@ led in over me that I was a min@@ ority , and in my own home country , based on one fac@@ et of my character .
I was leg@@ ally and in@@ dispu@@ tab@@ ly a secon@@ d-@@ class citizen .
I was not an activis@@ t .
I wave no fl@@ ags in my own life .
But I was pl@@ agu@@ ed by this question : How could anyone vote to stri@@ p the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
How could they say that we as a group were not deser@@ ving of equal rights as somebody else ?
W@@ ere we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consci@@ ously met a victim of their discrimination ?
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were cas@@ ting into secon@@ d-@@ class citiz@@ en@@ ship it might make it harder for them to do .
It might give them pause .
Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photograph@@ ically without any arti@@ fice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whis@@ kers without the fear of him ri@@ pping your face off .
For me , photography is not just about expos@@ ing film , it &apos;s about expos@@ ing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far@@ -@@ off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mu@@ g@@ shots if you will .
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limit@@ less number of people .
( Laughter ) So this was a very large under@@ taking , and to do it we needed some help .
So I ran out in the free@@ zing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
And I took those photographs , and I went to the H@@ R@@ C and I asked them for some help .
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
And then we made this .
( Music ) Video : I &apos;m i@@ O T@@ ill@@ ett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City . ( Music )
Sel@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is a photographi@@ c record of L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q America today .
My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the L@@ G@@ B@@ T@@ Q spectrum in any way .
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
( Music ) &quot; We hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evid@@ ent that all men are created equal . &quot;
It &apos;s written in the Dec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ dependence .
We are failing as a nation to u@@ ph@@ old the mor@@ als upon which we were founded .
There is no equality in the United States .
&#91; &quot; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; M@@ arri@@ age &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Fre@@ e@@ dom &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ l rights &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ at every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can leg@@ ally be fi@@ red just for your sexu@@ ality .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Ri@@ ghts Cam@@ paig@@ n .
I want to take the project across the country .
I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
( Music ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Sel@@ f evid@@ ent tru@@ ths &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; 4,000 faces across America &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Music ) ( Applause ) i@@ O T@@ ill@@ ett Wright : Absolu@@ tely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
Al@@ most 8@@ 5,000 people watched that video , and then they started em@@ ailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their tow@@ ns and help them to show their faces .
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticip@@ ated .
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocab@@ ul@@ ary .
So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small@@ -@@ town Texas , we found evidence that the initial pre@@ mise was dead on .
V@@ isi@@ bility really is key .
F@@ am@@ ili@@ arity really is the g@@ at@@ e@@ way drug to empathy .
Once an issue po@@ ps up in your own back@@ yard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympath@@ y for it or explore a new perspective on it .
Of course , in my trav@@ els I met people who leg@@ ally divor@@ c@@ ed their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern B@@ ap@@ tis@@ ts who swit@@ ched ch@@ ur@@ ches because their child was a les@@ bi@@ an .
S@@ parking empathy had become the back@@ bone of Sel@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths .
But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Sel@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differences between us .
In fact , on the contr@@ ary , it high@@ lights them .
It pres@@ ents , not just the complex@@ ities found in a proces@@ sion of different human beings , but the complex@@ ities found within each individual person .
It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; &quot; g@@ ays &quot; &quot; was inher@@ ently fl@@ aw@@ ed , because there were a million different sh@@ ades of gay .
Here I was trying to help , and I had perpe@@ tu@@ ated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid — yet another box .
At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quanti@@ fy themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
And I watched so many existenti@@ al crises un@@ fold in front of me .
( Laughter ) People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
Can you quanti@@ fy your openness ?
Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people op@@ ted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks .
Of course , there were lots of people who op@@ ted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nu@@ anced .
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to ref@@ er to as &quot; &quot; Gre@@ y . &quot; &quot; Let me be clear though — and this is very important — in no way am I saying that pre@@ ference doesn &apos;t exist .
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological im@@ per@@ ative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be gre@@ y .
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
( Laughter ) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-@@ dimensional .
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
And the reality that this pres@@ ents is a complicated one .
Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employ@@ ee for homosexu@@ al behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ al experiences so far ?
Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexu@@ al experiences th@@ us far ?
Where exactly does one become a secon@@ d-@@ class citizen ?
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my trav@@ els is just what a poor bin@@ ding agent sexual orientation is .
After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many j@@ er@@ ks and s@@ wee@@ the@@ arts and Demo@@ cr@@ ats and Re@@ public@@ ans and j@@ oc@@ ks and que@@ ens and every other polar@@ ization you can possibly think of within the L@@ G@@ B@@ T community as there are within the human race .
A@@ side from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of pre@@ judi@@ ce and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
So in the end@@ less pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of faces that Sel@@ f E@@ vi@@ dent T@@ ru@@ ths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more plat@@ forms , bus shel@@ ters , bill@@ boards , Facebook pages , screen sav@@ ers , perhaps in watching this proces@@ sion of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
H@@ op@@ efully these categories , these bin@@ aries , these over@@ -@@ simplifi@@ ed boxes will begin to become us@@ eless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
What we see are human beings in all their multipl@@ icity .
And seeing them makes it harder to den@@ y their humanity .
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to den@@ y their human rights .
So is it me particularly that you would choose to den@@ y the right to housing , the right to adop@@ t children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
Am I the one that you choose to dis@@ own as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fi@@ rem@@ an ?
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
So please don &apos;t gre@@ et us as strangers , gre@@ et us as your fellow human beings , period .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine sh@@ af@@ t in Ghana .
The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I can feel the brush of swe@@ at@@ y bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the sh@@ af@@ t is this c@@ ac@@ op@@ hon@@ y of men cou@@ gh@@ ing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
Like the others , I wear a f@@ lic@@ k@@ ering , cheap flash@@ light tied to my head with this el@@ as@@ tic , tat@@ tered band , and I can barely make out the sli@@ ck tree lim@@ bs holding up the walls of the three-@@ foot square hole dro@@ pping hundreds of feet into the earth .
When my hand sli@@ ps , I suddenly remember a min@@ er I had met days before who had lost his gri@@ p and fell coun@@ t@@ less feet down that sh@@ af@@ t .
As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , ris@@ king their lives without pay@@ ment or com@@ pens@@ ation , and often dying .
I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re tr@@ apped in slavery .
For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been document@@ ing indi@@ gen@@ ous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the so@@ le exhi@@ bit@@ or at the V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver Peace S@@ um@@ mit .
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , an N@@ GO dedicated to eradic@@ ating modern day slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and hon@@ est@@ ly ash@@ amed at my own lack of knowledge of this atro@@ city in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
It started burning a hole in my stom@@ ach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves and offer them my help .
Th@@ us began my journey into modern day slavery .
O@@ dd@@ ly , I had been to many of these places before .
Some I even considered like my second home .
But this time , I would see the skelet@@ ons hidden in the clo@@ set .
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people en@@ slav@@ ed in the world today .
That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ Atlantic sl@@ ave trade .
A hundred and fif@@ ty years ago , an agricultural sl@@ ave cost about three times the annu@@ al sal@@ ary of an American worker .
That equ@@ ates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
Yet today , entire families can be en@@ slav@@ ed for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
A@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly , slavery gener@@ ates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
Many have been tric@@ ked by false prom@@ ises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that en@@ slav@@ ed people produce have value , but the people producing them are dispos@@ able .
S@@ lav@@ ery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
In India and Ne@@ p@@ al , I was introduced to the br@@ ick kil@@ ns .
This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or D@@ ante &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
En@@ velop@@ ed in temper@@ atures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were clo@@ a@@ ked in a heavy blan@@ ket of dust , while mechan@@ ically stac@@ king bric@@ ks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scor@@ ching kil@@ ns to trucks hundreds of y@@ ards away .
D@@ ea@@ den@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ ony and ex@@ haus@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe de@@ hydr@@ ation made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al .
So per@@ vas@@ ive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ce@@ ased working .
Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cru@@ iser to clean out my g@@ ear and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
Back in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to cry , but the abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said , &quot; &quot; Lis@@ a , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot; &quot; And he very clearly explained to me that emotional dis@@ plays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I &apos;d have to rely on F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves to work within the system for their liber@@ ation , and I tru@@ sted that they would .
As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heart@@ break .
In the Himal@@ ay@@ as , I found children carrying stone for miles down mount@@ ain@@ ous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
The big sheets of sl@@ ate were heav@@ ier than the children carrying them , and the kids ho@@ isted them from their heads using these hand@@ made har@@ n@@ esses of sticks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n cl@@ oth .
It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhel@@ ming .
How can we affect something so insi@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ vas@@ ive ?
Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ slav@@ ed , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
They have nothing to compare it to .
When these vill@@ agers cl@@ aimed their freedom , the slav@@ e@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center r@@ alli@@ ed for them to pers@@ ev@@ ere , and abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ists on the ground helped them get a qu@@ arry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Se@@ x traff@@ ic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work saf@@ ely within this particular industry .
In K@@ ath@@ man@@ du , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had previ@@ ously been sex sl@@ aves themselves .
They us@@ her@@ ed me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , di@@ m@@ ly fluor@@ escent lit bas@@ ement .
This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se .
It was more like a restaurant .
C@@ ab@@ in restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced pro@@ stitution .
Each has small , private rooms , where the sl@@ aves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to enter@@ tain the clients , encour@@ aging them to buy more food and alcoho@@ l .
Each cu@@ bic@@ le is dark and d@@ ing@@ y , identified with a painted number on the wall , and parti@@ tioned by pl@@ y@@ wood and a cur@@ tain .
The workers here often end@@ ure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
St@@ anding in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ apped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back doors .
There were no windows large enough to climb through .
These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex traff@@ ic@@ king , occu@@ rs in our own back@@ yard as well .
T@@ ens of hundreds of people are en@@ slav@@ ed in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic serv@@ itude , and the list can go on .
Rec@@ ently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 3@@ 00,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The tex@@ tile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about sl@@ ave labor .
I visited villages in India where entire families were en@@ slav@@ ed in the silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
The dy@@ ed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
They mix dy@@ e in these big bar@@ rels , and they submer@@ ge the silk into the liquid up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the dy@@ e is toxic .
My interpre@@ ter told me their stories .
&quot; &quot; We have no freedom , &quot; &quot; they said .
&quot; &quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go some@@ place else where we actually get paid for our dy@@ eing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are en@@ slav@@ ed on L@@ ake Vol@@ ta , the largest man@@ -@@ made lake in the world .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all en@@ slav@@ ed .
Children are taken from their families and traff@@ icked and van@@ ished , and they &apos;re forced to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
This young child is eight years old .
He was trem@@ bling when our boat approach@@ ed , frighten@@ ed it would run over his tiny can@@ o@@ e .
He was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be kno@@ cked in the water .
The skelet@@ al tree lim@@ bs submer@@ ged in L@@ ake Vol@@ ta often catch the fishing nets , and w@@ ear@@ y , frighten@@ ed children are thrown into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lines .
Many of them dro@@ wn .
For as long as he can rec@@ all , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
Ter@@ ri@@ fied of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he passes that down to the younger sl@@ aves that he man@@ ages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hau@@ ling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
in the cold , win@@ dy night .
And it &apos;s important to note that these nets we@@ igh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was res@@ cu@@ ed from a fishing village .
I met him at a shelter where F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves re@@ habil@@ it@@ ates victims of slavery .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a bat@@ h at the well , pour@@ ing big buc@@ kets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possibility .
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
D@@ ri@@ ving down a road in Ghana with partners of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , a fellow abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a mo@@ ped suddenly sp@@ ed up to our cru@@ iser and t@@ apped on the window .
He told us to follow him down a dir@@ t road into the jungle .
At the end of the road , he ur@@ ged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
Then he pointed toward this barely visible foot@@ path , and said , &quot; &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot; &quot; As we started down the path , we pushed aside the v@@ ines bloc@@ king the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the tr@@ ail had become floo@@ ded by recent r@@ ains , so I ho@@ isted the photo g@@ ear above my head as we desc@@ ended into these wat@@ ers up to my chest .
After another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tr@@ ail ab@@ rup@@ tly ended at a clear@@ ing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of en@@ slav@@ ed people labor@@ ing .
Many women had children str@@ apped to their backs while they were p@@ ann@@ ing for gold , w@@ ading in water pois@@ oned by mer@@ cur@@ y .
Mer@@ cur@@ y is used in the extr@@ action process .
These min@@ ers are en@@ slav@@ ed in a mine sh@@ af@@ t in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the sh@@ af@@ t , they were so@@ aking w@@ et from their own swe@@ at .
I remember looking into their tired , bloo@@ d@@ shot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
The sh@@ af@@ ts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be trans@@ ported to another area , where the stone will be pou@@ n@@ ded so that they can extract the gold .
At first gl@@ ance , the pou@@ n@@ ding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fr@@ ing@@ es , and children too .
All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this mus@@ cular person will end up like this one here , rac@@ ked with tubercu@@ lo@@ sis and mer@@ cur@@ y pois@@ oning in just a few years .
This is Man@@ ur@@ u . When his father died , his uncle traff@@ icked him to work with him in the mines .
When his uncle died , Man@@ ur@@ u inher@@ ited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being en@@ slav@@ ed in the mines .
When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated .
On top of that , Man@@ ur@@ u has tubercu@@ lo@@ sis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine sh@@ af@@ t .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activis@@ ts like F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , and it &apos;s this sort of determin@@ ation , in the face of un@@ imaginable odds , that f@@ ills me with complete a@@ we .
I want to shine a light on slavery .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of cand@@ les with me , and with the help of my interpre@@ ter , I im@@ par@@ ted to the people I was photograph@@ ing that I wanted to illumin@@ ate their stories and their pl@@ ight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ ar@@ ing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to toler@@ ate atro@@ cities like slavery .
These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deser@@ ving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , m@@ ist@@ re@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
I hope that these images aw@@ a@@ ken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ign@@ ite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the be@@ ast of bon@@ d@@ age can continue to live in the shado@@ ws .
Thank you very much .

The dec@@ or@@ ative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years .
But mo@@ derni@@ zation actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire .
R@@ ural to urban migration meant that new@@ found industrial materials started to replace har@@ d-@@ to-@@ com@@ e-@@ by natural gr@@ asses .
So , here you can see the change from use — starting to use contemporary materials .
These pieces date back from the &apos; 4@@ 0s to the late &apos; 5@@ 0s .
In the &apos; 90s , my interest and passion for transi@@ tional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squ@@ at@@ ter camp outside D@@ urban .
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and ment@@ oring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
And the project soon grew from five to 50 we@@ av@@ ers in about a year .
So@@ on we had out@@ grown the scr@@ ap y@@ ards , what they could provide , so we co@@ er@@ c@@ ed a wire manufactu@@ rer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bo@@ b@@ b@@ ins , but to produce to our color speci@@ fications .
At the same time , I was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethni@@ c , a little bit more contemporary .
So I developed a whole range around — mass@@ -@@ produced range — that obviously f@@ it@@ ted into a much high@@ er-@@ end dec@@ or market that could be ex@@ ported and also service our local market .
We started experim@@ enting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it &apos;s become our pet project . It &apos;s successful , it &apos;s been running for 12 years . And we supply the Con@@ ran shops , and D@@ onna Kar@@ an , and so it &apos;s kind of great .
This is our group , our main group of we@@ av@@ ers .
They come on a wee@@ kly basis to D@@ urban .
They all have bank accoun@@ ts .
They &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
It &apos;s a wee@@ kly tur@@ n@@ around of production .
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of .
And that &apos;s also mo@@ derni@@ zed today , and it &apos;s sup@@ porting work for 300 we@@ av@@ ers .
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .

In an age of global stri@@ fe and climate change , I &apos;m here to answer the all important question : Why is sex so dam@@ n good ?
If you &apos;re laughing , you know what I mean .
Here &apos;s why . Back in university , we had a quick project to design some sol@@ ar@@ -@@ powered c@@ loc@@ ks .
Here &apos;s my clock .
It uses something called the d@@ war@@ f sun@@ flower , which grows to about 12 inches in height .
Now , as you know , sun@@ flowers track the sun during the course of the day .
So in the morning , you see which direction the sun@@ flower is facing , and you mark it on the bl@@ ank area in the base .
At noon , you mark the changed position of the sun@@ flower , and in the evening again , and that &apos;s your clock .
Now , I know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
So , in my completely un@@ bi@@ ased , subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant .
However , here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s five magni@@ fying glasses with a shot glass under each one .
In each shot glass is a different sc@@ ented oil .
In the morning , the sunlight will shine down on the first magni@@ fying glass , focusing a bea@@ m of light on the shot glass underneath .
This will warm up the sc@@ ented oil inside , and a particular smell will be em@@ it@@ ted .
So during the course of the day , five different sm@@ ells are dispers@@ ed throughout that environment .
Any@@ one living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
You can see why I hate Chris .
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose .
This problem &apos;s been bu@@ gging me for well over a decade .
All right , let &apos;s get back to the question of why sex is so good .
Many years after the solar powered c@@ loc@@ ks project , a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
And when she said this , I had an epi@@ ph@@ any .
To do this , I dev@@ ised something called the five senses graph .
Al@@ ong the y-@@ axis , you have a scale from zero to 10 , and along the x-@@ axis , you have , of course , the five senses .
Any@@ time I had a memor@@ able experience in my life , I would record it on this graph like a five senses di@@ ary .
Bi@@ ke designer : This is &#91; unclear &#93; , cu@@ st@@ om bike designer .
( Mot@@ or@@ cy@@ le re@@ v@@ ving ) &#91; S@@ ound &#93; &#91; Tou@@ ch &#93; &#91; S@@ ight &#93; &#91; Sm@@ ell &#93; &#91; Tas@@ te &#93; J@@ L : And that &apos;s how the five senses graph works .
So here are some other results .
The first is for instant no@@ od@@ les .
Now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
You know . ( S@@ l@@ ur@@ ps ) Ne@@ ed@@ less to say , I no longer d@@ ine with these people .
OK , next , clu@@ b@@ bing .
All right , and smoking .
Here I found touch is at &#91; six &#93; , and one of the reasons is that smo@@ kers told me the sensation of holding a cigar@@ ette and bringing it up to your li@@ ps is a big part of the smoking experience , which shows , it &apos;s kind of scary to think how well cigar@@ ettes are designed by the manufactu@@ r@@ ers .
It would , of course , be a horizon@@ tal line along the top .
In fact , in the years that I gather@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
That is , of course , sex . Great sex .
Res@@ pon@@ dents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
So the five senses theory does help explain why sex is so good .
Now in the middle of all this five senses work , I suddenly remembered the sol@@ ar@@ -@@ powered c@@ loc@@ ks project from my youth .
And I realized this theory also explains why Chris &apos;s clock is so much better than mine .
You see , my clock only foc@@ uses on sight , and a little bit of touch .
Here &apos;s Chris &apos;s clock .
It &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
In fact , in terms of the five senses , Chris &apos;s clock is a revolution .
And that &apos;s what this theory taught me about my field .
You see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve igno@@ red the other three senses .
Chris &apos;s clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
Here &apos;s three quick ideas I came up with .
We could call this &quot; &quot; the perf@@ um@@ ator . &quot; &quot; All right , next .
So I brush my teeth twice a day , and what if we had a to@@ oth@@ brush that tas@@ tes like cand@@ y , and when the taste of cand@@ y ran out , you &apos;d know it &apos;s time to change your to@@ oth@@ brush ?
Finally , I have a thing for the keys on a flu@@ te or a cl@@ ar@@ inet .
It &apos;s not just the way they look , but I love the way they feel when you press down on them .
Now , I don &apos;t play the flu@@ te or the cl@@ ar@@ inet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
Now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
Now , I realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
There &apos;s also the six emotions and that el@@ u@@ sive x-@@ factor .
Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk .
Until then , please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs .
Oh , one last thing before I leave .
And the best way to do that is with free cand@@ y .
You guys ready ?
All right .

When I was six years old , I received my gi@@ f@@ ts .
My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea .
She wanted us to experience rece@@ iving gi@@ f@@ ts but also learning the virtu@@ e of compl@@ im@@ enting each other .
and three left .
And I was one of them .
And the compl@@ im@@ ents stopped .
And the teacher was fre@@ aking out .
And without the hu@@ mor .
There was nothing funny about that day .
So that was one version of me , and I would die to avoid being in that situation again — to get rej@@ ected in public again .
That &apos;s one version .
Then fas@@ t-@@ forward eight years .
Bill Gates came to my hom@@ etown — Beijing , China — to speak , and I saw his message .
I fell in love with that guy .
I thought , w@@ ow , I know what I want to do now .
And I didn &apos;t make this up , I did write that letter .
And here it is — ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to read this through — ( Laughter ) This is also bad hand@@ writing , but I did high@@ light some key words .
You get the idea .
( Laughter ) So ...
that was another version of me : one who will con@@ quer the world .
Well , then two years later , I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States .
I jumped on it , because that was where Bill Gates lived , right ?
( Laughter ) I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey .
Then , fas@@ t-@@ forward another 14 years .
I was 30 .
N@@ ope , I didn &apos;t build that company .
I didn &apos;t even start .
I was actually a marketing man@@ ager for a For@@ tune 500 company .
And I felt I was stuck ; I was stag@@ nant .
Why is that ?
Where is that 14@@ -year-old who wrote that letter ?
One wanted to con@@ quer the world — make a difference — another was afraid of rej@@ ection .
And every time that six@@ -year-old won .
And this fear even pers@@ isted after I started my own company .
When I was an entrepreneur , I was presented with an investment opportunity , and then I was turned down .
And that rej@@ ection hurt me .
It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there .
But then I thought , hey , would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rej@@ ection ?
Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that ?
No way .
And this is where it cli@@ cked for me .
OK , I can build a better company .
I have to put him back in his place .
So this is where I went online and looked for help .
Google was my friend .
Then I came up with a bunch of &quot; &quot; ra@@ h-@@ ra@@ h &quot; &quot; inspir@@ ational articles about &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t take it personally , just overcome it . &quot; &quot; Who doesn &apos;t know that ?
Then I found this website by luck .
It &apos;s called rej@@ ec@@ tion@@ therap@@ y@@ .@@ com@@ .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Re@@ j@@ ection Th@@ er@@ ap@@ y &quot; &quot; was this game invented by this Can@@ adi@@ an entrepreneur .
His name is Jason Com@@ ely .
And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rej@@ ection , and every day get rej@@ ected at something , and then by the end , you des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze yourself from the pain .
And I loved that idea .
And so here &apos;s what I did .
This is what the blog looked like .
Day One ...
( Laughter ) B@@ orrow 100 dollars from a stranger .
So this is where I went to where I was working .
I came down@@ stairs and I saw this big guy sitting behind a desk .
He looked like a security gu@@ ard .
So I just approach@@ ed him .
And I was just walking and that was the long@@ est walk of my life — hair on the back of my neck standing up , I was swe@@ ating and my heart was pou@@ n@@ ding .
( Laughter ) And he looked up , he &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot;
And I just said , &quot; &quot; No ? I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; Then I turned around , and I just ran .
I looked like this kid in &quot; &quot; The Si@@ x@@ th S@@ ense . &quot; &quot; I saw dead people .
( Laughter ) But then I saw this guy .
You know , he wasn &apos;t that menac@@ ing .
He was a ch@@ ub@@ by , lo@@ ve@@ able guy , and he even asked me , &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; In fact , he invited me to explain myself .
And I could &apos;ve said many things .
I didn &apos;t do any of that .
All I did was run .
I felt , w@@ ow , this is like a micro@@ cos@@ m of my life .
Every time I felt the sli@@ gh@@ test rej@@ ection , I would just run as fast as I could .
And you know what ?
The next day , no matter what happens , I &apos;m not going to run .
I &apos;ll stay engaged .
And by the way , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ve ever done bur@@ ger ref@@ ill .
( Laughter ) I think they &apos;re still there .
But the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time was no longer there , just because I stayed engaged — because I didn &apos;t run .
I said , &quot; &quot; Wow , great , I &apos;m already learning things .
This is where my life was turned up@@ side down .
I went to a K@@ ris@@ p@@ y K@@ re@@ me .
I &apos;m sure they have some here , too .
And I went in , I said , &quot; &quot; Can you make me dou@@ gh@@ nuts that look like Olym@@ pic symbols ?
Basically , you inter@@ link five dou@@ gh@@ nuts together ... &quot; &quot; I mean there &apos;s no way they could say yes , right ?
The dou@@ gh@@ n@@ ut maker took me so seriously .
And I was so touched .
I just couldn &apos;t believe it .
And that video got over five million views on You@@ tube .
The world couldn &apos;t believe that either .
And I became famous .
A lot of people started writing emails to me and saying , &quot; &quot; What you &apos;re doing is awesome . &quot; &quot; But you know , f@@ ame and not@@ ori@@ ety did not do anything to me .
What I really wanted to do was learn , and to change myself .
So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rej@@ ection into this play@@ ground — into this research project .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the back@@ yard .
I don &apos;t want to waste your flower .
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s putting all the doubt on the floor .
People were more likely to say yes to me .
And then I learned I could ful@@ fill my life dream ...
by asking .
This is me — you probably can &apos;t see , this is a bad picture .
You know , sometimes you get rej@@ ected by lighting , you know ?
Why ? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world , who change the way we live and the way we think , are the people who were met with initial and often violent rej@@ ections .
People like Martin Luther King , J@@ r . , like Mah@@ at@@ ma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela , or even Jesus Chris@@ t .
These people did not let rej@@ ection define them .
They let their own reaction after rej@@ ection define themselves .
And they embrac@@ ed rej@@ ection .
And we don &apos;t have to be those people to learn about rej@@ ection , and in my case , rej@@ ection was my cur@@ se , was my boo@@ ge@@ y@@ man .
It has bo@@ ther@@ ed me my whole life because I was running away from it .
Then I started embrac@@ ing it .
I started teaching people how to turn rej@@ ections into opportunities .
Don &apos;t run .
Thank you .

So I guess I was the lucky one .
My mother had 16 pregn@@ anci@@ es .
From 16 pregn@@ anci@@ es , five of us are alive .
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So as a result , my father sent me to America .
I came to America .
There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
So as soon as I complet@@ ed my education , I brought my family to America .
I ear@@ ned good money .
My family was here .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and surve@@ yed and looked and looked .
He was a mul@@ la@@ h .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ ghted with the outcome of my work .
Ri@@ f@@ les on their shoul@@ ders , they bloc@@ ked the road .
My leg was sh@@ aking , and I got outside .
By the time I came to the office , of course my tr@@ ain@@ ers were gone .
My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
Today , they are the best tr@@ ain@@ ers .
That tells you that education transform@@ s people .
We were going everywhere .
But you know what happened to my country .
But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
We have one poet , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Those are my dad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Nairobi National Park is not f@@ enced in the south widely , which means wild animals like z@@ e@@ bras migr@@ ate out of the park fre@@ ely .
So predat@@ ors like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck .
This is one of the co@@ ws which was killed at night , and I just w@@ oke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bul@@ l we had .
My community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up h@@ ating lions so much .
The mor@@ ans are the w@@ arri@@ ors who protect our community and the liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
So they kill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
And a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed .
But lions are very clever . ( Laughter ) They will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . ( Laughter ) So he jum@@ ps in and kill@@ s the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . ( Laughter ) So I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motor@@ cycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a broken flash@@ light .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery suppl@@ ies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a transformer .
And the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
As you can see , the bul@@ bs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
And my neighbor@@ ing homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ opar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ phants away from people &apos;s far@@ ms .
Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a schol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brook@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fun@@ d@@ raising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the sav@@ ann@@ a grass@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Ash@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .

( Applause ) May@@ a Pen@@ n : I &apos;ve been drawing ever since I could hold a cr@@ ay@@ on , and I &apos;ve been making anim@@ ated flip books since I was three years old .
At that age , I also learned about what an anim@@ ator was .
There was a program on TV about jobs most kids don &apos;t know about .
When I understood that an anim@@ ator makes the carto@@ ons I saw on TV , I immediately said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I want to be . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said it mentally or out loud , but that was a gre@@ at@@ ly defin@@ ing moment in my life .
An@@ im@@ ation and art has always been my first love .
It was my love for technology that spar@@ ked the idea for &quot; &quot; Mal@@ icious D@@ ishes . &quot; &quot; There was a virus on my computer , and I was trying to get rid of it , and all of a sudden , I just thought , what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer ?
Maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do vir@@ us@@ y things ?
And th@@ us , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ icious D@@ ishes &quot; &quot; was born .
At four years old , my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again .
That started my love for technology .
I built my first website myself in H@@ T@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m learning J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt and P@@ y@@ thon .
I &apos;m also working on an anim@@ ated series called &quot; &quot; The P@@ oll@@ in@@ ators . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other pollin@@ ators in our environment and why they &apos;re so important .
If plants aren &apos;t pollin@@ ated by the pollin@@ ators , then all creatures , including ourselves , that depend on these plants , would star@@ ve .
So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a super@@ hero team .
( Applause ) ( F@@ oo@@ t stom@@ p ) ( Music ) ( Ro@@ ar ) P@@ oll@@ in@@ ator : De@@ for@@ est@@ s@@ aur@@ us ! I should have known !
I need to call on the rest of the P@@ oll@@ in@@ ators !
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my anim@@ ations start with ideas , but what are ideas ?
I@@ de@@ as can s@@ park a movement .
I@@ de@@ as are opportunities and innovation .
I@@ de@@ as truly are what make the world go round .
If it wasn &apos;t for ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be where we are now with technology , medicine , art , culture , and how we even live our lives .
At eight years old , I took my ideas and started my own business called May@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as , and my non@@ profit , May@@ a &apos;s I@@ de@@ as for the Pl@@ an@@ et .
( Laughter ) And I make ec@@ o-@@ friendly clothing and access@@ ories .
I &apos;m 13 now , and although I started my business in 2008 , my artistic journey started way before then .
I was gre@@ at@@ ly influ@@ enced by art , and I wanted to in@@ corporate it in everything I did , even my business .
I would find different fabr@@ ics around the house , and say , &quot; &quot; This could be a scar@@ f or a h@@ at , &quot; &quot; and I had all these ideas for designs .
I noticed when I w@@ ore my cre@@ ations , people would stop me and say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s really cute . Where can I get one ? &quot;
And I thought , I can start my own business .
Now I didn &apos;t have any business plans at only eight years old .
I only knew I wanted to make pretty cre@@ ations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back .
My mom taught me how to se@@ w , and on my back por@@ ch , I would sit and make little head@@ ban@@ ds out of ri@@ b@@ bon , and I would write down the names and the price of each it@@ em .
I started making more it@@ ems like h@@ ats , scar@@ ves and bags .
So@@ on , my it@@ ems began selling all over the world , and I had customers in Den@@ mark , Italy , Australia , Canada and more .
Now , I had a lot to learn about my business , like br@@ anding and marketing , staying engaged with my customers , and seeing what sold the most and the least .
So@@ on , my business really started to take off .
Then one day , For@@ bes magazine cont@@ acted me when I was 10 years old .
( Laughter ) They wanted to feature me and my company in their article .
Now a lot of people ask me , why is your business ec@@ o-@@ friendly ?
I &apos;ve had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little .
My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good ste@@ ward to the environment .
I heard about how the dy@@ es in some clothing or the process of even making the it@@ ems was harm@@ ful to the people and the planet , so I started doing my own research , and I discovered that even after dy@@ eing has being complet@@ ed , there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment .
For example , the gr@@ in@@ ding of materials , or the dum@@ ping of dri@@ ed po@@ w@@ der materials .
These actions can pollu@@ te the air , making it toxic to anyone or anything that in@@ h@@ ales it .
So when I started my business , I knew two things : All of my it@@ ems had to be ec@@ o-@@ friendly , and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made went to local and global chari@@ ties and environmental organizations .
( Applause ) I feel I &apos;m part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only see@@ ks to have a successful business , but also a sustainable future .
I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without comprom@@ ising the ability of future generations to live in a green@@ er tomorrow .
We live in a big , diverse and beautiful world , and that makes me even more passionate to save it .
But it &apos;s never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world .
It takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are spar@@ ked .
That is when opportunities and innovation are created , and that is why ideas come to life .
Thank you , and peace and bless@@ ings .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ itch@@ ell : So , you heard May@@ a talk about the amazing parents who are behind this incredible woman . Where are they ?
Please , Mr. and M@@ r@@ s. Pen@@ n . Would you just — Ah !
( Applause )
You know , one of the intense plea@@ sures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones pol@@ ished by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
Just to know that J@@ agu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the Mil@@ ky W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still reson@@ ate with meaning , or that in the Himal@@ aya , the Bu@@ ddhis@@ ts still pursu@@ e the breath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ logy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it successfully , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ atives .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initi@@ ation r@@ ites .
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of the dance in every culture .
And whether it is the Pen@@ an in the forests of Bor@@ ne@@ o , or the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Haiti , or the w@@ arri@@ ors in the K@@ ai@@ su@@ t desert of Northern Kenya , the Cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the An@@ des , or a car@@ avan@@ serai in the middle of the Sahara — this is in@@ cident@@ ally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago — or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ pes of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , Everest , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
All of these pe@@ op@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelop@@ s the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , intu@@ itions brought into being by the human imagination since the d@@ awn of consciousness .
The eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great legacy .
It &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an aston@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive species .
And just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere — and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
No biologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that — the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scenario in the realm of biological diversity — scar@@ cel@@ y approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
And the great indic@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of vocab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ mati@@ cal rules .
A language is a flash of the human spirit .
It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
Every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ sh@@ ed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whis@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children .
They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be envelop@@ ed in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticip@@ ate the promise of the children ?
And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful fate is indeed the pl@@ ight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the grave the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ uba . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
Let &apos;s make it Ko@@ gi . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Take , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ west Amazon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ ond@@ a who believe that mytho@@ log@@ ically they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sacred sn@@ akes .
Now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not distingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heav@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; &quot; lingu@@ istic exo@@ gam@@ y : &quot; &quot; you must marry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
And this is all ro@@ oted in the mytho@@ logical past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
Or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes I ever lived with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an astonishing people first cont@@ acted peace@@ fully in 195@@ 8 .
In 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly ges@@ tures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the dev@@ il , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn &apos;t just sp@@ ear out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ ared each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
We trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gies back eight generations , and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mitted that one of the fel@@ lows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway . ( Laughter ) But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ ious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
Their hun@@ ters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ aces and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assign@@ ment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , in@@ filtr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of Du@@ val@@ ier &apos;s strength and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ acou@@ tes , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the poison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vo@@ dou@@ n . And Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
On the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex met@@ ap@@ hys@@ ical world@@ view .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christi@@ an@@ ity , Islam , Bu@@ ddhis@@ m , Jud@@ ais@@ m , whatever .
There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assum@@ ption being that sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ till@@ ation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the slavery era .
But , what makes Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
So , the living give birth to the spir@@ its .
The spir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from bene@@ ath the Great W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the soul of the living , so that for that brief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; &quot; You white people go to church and speak about God .
We dance in the temple and become God . &quot; &quot; And because you are poss@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit — how can you be har@@ med ?
So you see these astonishing demonstr@@ ations : Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with imp@@ un@@ ity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when cataly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ itation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Ko@@ gi of the Sierra N@@ ev@@ ada de Santa Mar@@ ta in northern Colom@@ bia .
D@@ esc@@ end@@ ants of the ancient T@@ air@@ ona civilization which once car@@ p@@ eted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ tal plain of Colom@@ bia , in the wake of the conqu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isolated volcan@@ ic mas@@ sif that so@@ ars above the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ tal plain .
In a bloo@@ d@@ st@@ ained continent , these people alone were never conqu@@ ered by the Spanish .
To this day , they remain rul@@ ed by a ritu@@ al pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ tered in a shado@@ w@@ y world of darkness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods deliber@@ ately chosen to mim@@ ic the nine months of g@@ estation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone maintain the cos@@ mic — or we might say the ecological — balance .
And at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . And in that cryst@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect . &quot; &quot; They call themselves the &quot; &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; &quot; and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
Wh@@ enever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either in@@ vo@@ ke Rou@@ ss@@ eau and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; &quot; noble sav@@ age , &quot; &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simplicity , or altern@@ atively , we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are neither senti@@ mental nor wea@@ k@@ ened by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ illing win@@ ds of Ti@@ bet , but they have , n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritu@@ al , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ stique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is bre@@ ath@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an A@@ pu spirit that will direct his or her des@@ tiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Mont@@ ana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
Whether it &apos;s the ab@@ ode of a spirit or a pile of ore is ir@@ relevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Colum@@ bia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the ab@@ ode of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the Cro@@ o@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of He@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spir@@ its that d@@ well@@ ed at the north end of the world , spir@@ its they would have to engage during their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different re@@ alities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Nor@@ th@@ west Amazon just last A@@ pr@@ il .
This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sh@@ aman &apos;s re@@ per@@ toire .
What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er pharmac@@ ological potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of bet@@ a-@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly halluc@@ ino@@ gen@@ ic — to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue h@@ az@@ y smoke dri@@ ft across your consciousness — but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ria vi@@ ri@@ dis .
This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine , 5@@ -@@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ anom@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine .
To have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ rel lined with bar@@ o@@ que paintings and l@@ anding on a sea of electricity . ( Laughter ) It doesn &apos;t create the dist@@ or@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard E@@ van Sh@@ ul@@ tes — who is a man who spar@@ ked the psych@@ ed@@ el@@ ic era with his discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in Mexico in the 193@@ 0s — I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as halluc@@ ino@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a halluc@@ ination . ( Laughter ) But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ atu@@ red by an enzy@@ me found naturally in the human gut called mono@@ amine ox@@ id@@ ase .
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ c@@ tion with some other chemical that den@@ atures the M@@ AO .
Now , the fascinating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ AO inhi@@ bit@@ ors of the precise sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine . So you ask yourself a question .
How , in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cular plants , do these people find these two morph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ related plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
Well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; &quot; trial and error , &quot; &quot; which is exposed to be meaning@@ less .
But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot; &quot; Well , what does that mean ?
This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 17 vari@@ eties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
And then you ask them how they establ@@ ish their tax@@ onom@@ y and they say , &quot; &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ eties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens . ( Laughter ) Now — ( Applause ) — the problem — the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the pl@@ ight of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ aint and color@@ ful but somehow reduced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either activ@@ ely end@@ ors@@ ed or pas@@ sively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Si@@ oux Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ oux when they gave up the bow and ar@@ row any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and bu@@ g@@ gy .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threat@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . It is power , the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation .
Wh@@ erever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living pe@@ op@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ forestation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the Pen@@ an — a nom@@ adi@@ c people from Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia , from Sar@@ aw@@ ak — a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to serv@@ itude and pro@@ stitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of Bor@@ ne@@ o away
to the South China Sea , where the Japanese fre@@ igh@@ ters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest — or , in the case of the Y@@ anom@@ ami , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
Or if we go into the mountains of Ti@@ bet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political domin@@ ation .
You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univers@@ ally , in many quarters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
And you cannot understand the pain of Ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once trav@@ elled 6,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ du in Western China over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ as@@ tern Ti@@ bet to L@@ has@@ a with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to L@@ has@@ a that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred mon@@ uments tor@@ n apart to dust and ash@@ es , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the cad@@ res during the C@@ ul@@ tural Revolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the Pan@@ ch@@ en Lama .
That meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the Chinese invas@@ ion .
His uncle fl@@ ed with His Hol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to Ne@@ p@@ al .
His mother was incar@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
He was s@@ mu@@ ggl@@ ed into the jail at the age of two to hide bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t t@@ ails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
One day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard labor .
The pain of Ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the red@@ emp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mono@@ chrom@@ atic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embrace a poly@@ chrom@@ atic world of diversity ?
Mar@@ gar@@ et M@@ ead , the great anthropo@@ logist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ orph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
And it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 15@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ o@@ lith@@ ic Revolution — which gave us agriculture , at which time we succ@@ um@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the seed ; the poetry of the sh@@ aman was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hier@@ archy speci@@ alization sur@@ plus — is only 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
Now , that sh@@ allow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mill@@ en@@ nia .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all gard@@ ens find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . And there are great moments of optimism .
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of B@@ aff@@ in Island when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people , and this man , O@@ lay@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grandfather .
The Can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to establ@@ ish our so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ l@@ ements .
This old man &apos;s grandfather ref@@ used to go .
The family , fear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were originally made of fish wr@@ apped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hide .
So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the Arctic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
He simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin trou@@ s@@ ers and def@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . And as the f@@ eces began to free@@ ze , he shaped it into the form of a bl@@ ade .
He put a spr@@ ay of sal@@ iv@@ a on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally fro@@ ze solid , he but@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
He sk@@ in@@ ned the dog and improvis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ cage of the dog and improvis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappeared over the ice flo@@ es , shit knife in bel@@ t .
Talk about getting by with nothing . ( Laughter ) And this , in many ways — ( Applause ) — is a symbol of the res@@ ilience of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The Can@@ adi@@ an government in A@@ pr@@ il of 1999 gave back to total control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
It &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an independent territ@@ ory . They control all min@@ eral resources .
An amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can seek res@@ titu@@ tion with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote re@@ aches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
They &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the d@@ awn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked ge@@ ography of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accompl@@ ish anything .
We think that pol@@ em@@ ics — ( Applause ) — we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not persu@@ as@@ ive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television channel .
Our magazines are read by millions .
And what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ neys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away d@@ azz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ logy : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multi@@ cultural , pl@@ ur@@ alistic world where all of the wisdom of all pe@@ op@@ les can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you very much .

When I was seven years old , I saw my first public exec@@ ution .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Kore@@ an refugee .
If anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pris@@ oned and re@@ patri@@ ated .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an instant .
We are all Kore@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , due to 6@@ 7 years of division .
Am I South Kore@@ an or North Kore@@ an ?
So I started planning how to help them escape .
I was so surprised that a total stranger car@@ ed enough to ask .
I realized that this was a symbo@@ lic moment in my life .

This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we designed in 2007 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a circle .
It &apos;s a kind of end@@ less circulation on top of the roof .
If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
This is how the ro@@ of@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
The principal of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a hand@@ rail . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he ins@@ isted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net stic@@ king out from the edge of the roof ?
But we could keep that idea around the trees .
There are three trees po@@ pping through .
And we were allowed to call this ro@@ pe as a hand@@ rail .
But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them .
They fall into the net .
And you get more , and more , more .
( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
The boy on the bran@@ ch , he lo@@ ves the tree so he is eating the tree .
( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
It looks so nice from underneath .
Mon@@ keys in the zo@@ o .
( Laughter ) Fe@@ eding time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ aps .
You see with the flexible tubes , you want to spr@@ ay water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite normal .
But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s putting water into his bo@@ ots .
( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year .
And there is no b@@ ound@@ ary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
And also there is no b@@ ound@@ ary between class@@ rooms .
So there is no acou@@ stic barri@@ er at all .
When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get nervous .
Because there is no b@@ ound@@ ary .
And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occasion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
It &apos;s a natural process .
And secon@@ dly , we consider noise very important .
You know that children sleep better in noise .
They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
And you know , our kind grew up in the jungle with noise .
They need noise .
And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y bar .
You are not supposed to be in silence .
And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
And you should know that we can go ski@@ ing in -@@ 20 degrees in winter .
In summer you go swimming .
The sand is 50 degrees .
And also , you should know that you are water@@ proof .
You never mel@@ t in rain .
So , children are supposed to be outside .
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divide class@@ rooms .
They are supposed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A classroom .
And a wash@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some trees in the classroom .
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
( Laughter ) Mon@@ keys . ( Laughter )
And each classroom has at least one sky@@ light .
And this is where Santa Cl@@ au@@ s comes down at the time of Christmas .
This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ shaped kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
The building is only five meters tall with seven flo@@ ors .
And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
So you have to consider safety .
So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
They tried to go in .
He hit his head .
He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
He is res@@ il@@ ient . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
And then we put other children .
The traffic j@@ am is awful in Tokyo , as you know .
( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
Now these days , kids need a small do@@ sage of danger .
And in this kind of occasion , they learn to help each other .
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
And the circum@@ ference of this building is 18@@ 3 meters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
But the surprise is yet to come .
The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4,000 meters on average .
And these children have the highest ath@@ le@@ tic abilities among many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens .
The principal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tum@@ ble sometimes .
They need to get some injury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
And this is one of the attemp@@ ts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .

Here are some images of clu@@ sters of galaxies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
They are these huge collec@@ tions of galaxies , bound together by their mu@@ tual gravity .
So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars , but collec@@ tions of stars , or galaxies .
Now , by showing you some of these images , I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clu@@ sters are these beautiful objects , but more than that , I think galaxy clu@@ sters are myster@@ ious , they are surprising , and they &apos;re useful .
U@@ se@@ ful as the universe &apos;s most massive labor@@ at@@ ories .
And as labor@@ at@@ ories , to describe galaxy clu@@ sters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them .
And I think there are four major types , and the first type that I want to describe is prob@@ ing the very big .
So , how big ?
Well , here is an image of a particular galaxy clu@@ ster .
It is so massive that the light passing through it is being b@@ ent , it &apos;s being dist@@ or@@ ted by the extreme gravity of this clu@@ ster .
And , in fact , if you look very carefully you &apos;ll be able to see r@@ ings around this clu@@ ster .
Now , to give you a number , this particular galaxy clu@@ ster has a mass of over one million billion su@@ ns .
It &apos;s just mind-@@ bo@@ ggl@@ ing how massive these systems can get .
But more than their mass , they have this additional feature .
They are essentially isolated systems , so if we like , we can think of them as a sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down version of the entire universe .
And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales , such as , how does gravity work ?
might be answered by studying these systems .
So that was very big .
The second things is very hot .
Okay , if I take an image of a galaxy clu@@ ster , and I sub@@ tr@@ act away all of the star@@ light , what I &apos;m left with is this big , blue blo@@ b .
This is in false color .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
And the question is , if it &apos;s not galaxies , what is em@@ itting this light ?
The answer is hot gas , milli@@ on-@@ degree gas — in fact , it &apos;s plas@@ ma .
And the reason why it &apos;s so hot goes back to the previous slide .
The extreme gravity of these systems is acceler@@ ating particles of gas to great spe@@ eds , and great spe@@ eds means great temper@@ atures .
So this is the main idea , but science is a rough dra@@ ft .
There are many basic properties about this plas@@ ma that still con@@ fuse us , still puzzle us , and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot .
Third thing : prob@@ ing the very small .
Now , to explain this , I need to tell you a very distur@@ bing fact .
Most of the universe &apos;s matter is not made up of atoms .
You were li@@ ed to .
Most of it is made up of something very , very myster@@ ious , which we call dark matter .
Dar@@ k matter is something that doesn &apos;t like to interact very much , except through gravity , and of course we would like to learn more about it .
If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you want to know what happens when we sm@@ ash things together .
And dark matter is no exception .
Well , how do we do this ?
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to have to ask another one , which is , what happens when galaxy clu@@ sters col@@ li@@ de ?
Here is an image .
Since galaxy clu@@ sters are represent@@ ative sli@@ ces of the universe , sc@@ al@@ ed@@ -@@ down versions .
They are mostly made up of dark matter , and that &apos;s what you see in this blu@@ ish pur@@ ple .
The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
What &apos;s happened is a particle acceler@@ ator at a huge , huge scale .
And this is very important , because what it means is that very , very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab , might be com@@ pou@@ n@@ ded and com@@ pou@@ n@@ ded into something that we could possibly observe in nature .
So , it &apos;s very funny .
F@@ our@@ th thing : the physics of the very strange .
Cert@@ ain@@ ly what I &apos;ve said so far is crazy .
Okay , if there &apos;s anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy .
If I throw a ball into the air , I expect it to go up .
What I don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever@@ -@@ increasing rate .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , cosmo@@ logists understand why the universe is expanding .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s expanding at an ever@@ -@@ increasing rate .
They give the cause of this acceler@@ ated expansion a name , and they call it dark energy .
And , again , we want to learn more about it .
So , one particular question that we have is , how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
De@@ pend@@ ing on how strong it is , maybe structure forms faster or s@@ lower .
Well , the problem with the lar@@ ge-@@ scale structure of the universe is that it &apos;s horri@@ bly complicated .
Here is a computer simulation .
And we need a way to simpl@@ i@@ fy it .
Well , I like to think about this using an analo@@ gy .
If I want to understand the sin@@ king of the Tit@@ anic , the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off .
The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clu@@ sters of galaxies .
So , as I come to a close , you might feel slightly che@@ ated .
I mean , I began by talking about how galaxy clu@@ sters are useful , and I &apos;ve given some reasons , but what is their use really ?
Well , to answer this , I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars .
He had this to say : &quot; &quot; If I had asked people what they wanted , they would have said faster hor@@ ses . &quot; &quot; Today , we as a society are faced with many , many difficult problems .
And the solutions to these problems are not obvious .
They are not faster hor@@ ses .
They will require an enormous amount of scientific in@@ genu@@ ity .
So , yes , we need to focus , yes , we need to concentr@@ ate , but we also need to remember that innovation , in@@ genu@@ ity , inspiration — these things come when we broad@@ en our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out .
And I can &apos;t think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us . Thanks .

Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
At the time , I was cardi@@ ologist at UC@@ LA , speci@@ alizing in cardi@@ ac imaging techniques .
The call came from a veter@@ in@@ arian at the Los Angeles Z@@ oo .
An elderly female chimpanz@@ ee had wo@@ ken up with a facial dro@@ op and the veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the zo@@ o and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardi@@ ac cause .
And occasi@@ onally , on the very same day , I went on r@@ ounds at UC@@ LA Medic@@ al Center and at the Los Angeles Z@@ oo .
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
Now , I &apos;ve got a conf@@ ession to make .
Even though I studied compar@@ ative physi@@ ology and evolutionary biology as an under@@ gr@@ ad — I had even written my sen@@ ior thesis on Dar@@ win@@ ian theory — learning about the significant over@@ lap between the disorders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed w@@ a@@ ke@@ -up call for me .
So I started wondering , with all of these over@@ l@@ aps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veter@@ in@@ arian , or consul@@ t the veter@@ in@@ ary literature , for insi@@ ghts into one of my human patients ?
I mean , look , every single physician accep@@ ts some biological connection between animals and humans .
Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separ@@ ation in our world between the urban and the non@@ urban .
You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wo@@ ol grows on trees or that che@@ ese comes from a plant .
But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
P@@ hys@@ icians and scientists , we accept intell@@ ec@@ tually that our species , Homo sap@@ iens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
I feel it myself when I &apos;m listening to Moz@@ art or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my Mac@@ Bo@@ ok .
I feel that tu@@ g of human excep@@ tion@@ alism , even as I recognize the scienti@@ fically isol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ ior species , apart .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ in@@ duced heart failure .
But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uni@@ quel@@ y human .
V@@ eter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been diagno@@ sing , treating and even prev@@ enting emo@@ tionally in@@ duced symptoms in animals rang@@ ing from monkeys to fl@@ amin@@ gos , from to de@@ er to rabb@@ its , since the 197@@ 0s .
How many human lives might have been saved if this veter@@ in@@ ary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and cardi@@ ologists ?
Sel@@ f-@@ injury .
Some human patients harm themselves .
Some pl@@ uck out pat@@ ches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
Some animal patients also harm themselves .
There are birds that pl@@ uck out f@@ ea@@ thers .
There are st@@ allions that re@@ peti@@ tively b@@ ite their fl@@ anks until they ble@@ ed .
But veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even prev@@ enting self-@@ injury in their self-@@ inj@@ ur@@ ing animals .
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this veter@@ in@@ ary knowledge be put into the hands of psycho@@ therap@@ ists and parents and patients struggling with self-@@ injury ?
Po@@ st@@ par@@ tum depression and post@@ par@@ tum psycho@@ sis .
Sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depressed , and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psycho@@ tic .
They may ne@@ gl@@ ect their new@@ born , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
E@@ qu@@ ine veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that occasi@@ onally , a ma@@ re , soon after giving birth , will ne@@ gl@@ ect the fo@@ al , ref@@ using to nurse , and in some inst@@ ances , kick the fo@@ al , even to death .
But veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have dev@@ ised an intervention to deal with this fo@@ al rej@@ ection syndrome that involves increasing oxy@@ tocin in the ma@@ re .
Ox@@ y@@ tocin is the bon@@ ding hor@@ mone , and this leads to ren@@ e@@ wed interest , on the part of the ma@@ re , in her fo@@ al .
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / gy@@ n &apos;s and family doctors and patients who are struggling with post@@ par@@ tum depression and psycho@@ sis ?
Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the g@@ ulf between our fields remains large .
To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty laun@@ dry .
Some physici@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ bs about doctors who are not M@@ .D. &apos; s .
I &apos;m talking about denti@@ sts and op@@ tom@@ etr@@ ists and psycho@@ logists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
Of course , most physici@@ ans don &apos;t realize that it is harder to get into v@@ et school these days than medical school , and that when we go to medical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , Homo sap@@ iens , but veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in mammals , amph@@ i@@ bi@@ ans , re@@ pti@@ les , fish and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the v@@ ets for feeling an@@ no@@ yed by my profession &apos;s con@@ descen@@ sion and ignorance .
But here &apos;s one from the v@@ ets : What do you call a veter@@ in@@ arian who can only take care of one species ?
And through Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity con@@ fer@@ ences , where we bring medical schools together with veter@@ in@@ ary schools for collabor@@ tive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients .
And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and he@@ al .
Thank you .
Can ge@@ ographic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
I found myself in a hospital in an inten@@ si@@ ve-@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from emergency surgery .
And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
I started asking my questions , &quot; &quot; Well , why me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
&quot; Could my doctor have war@@ ned me ? &quot;
So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the form@@ ula for life and good health .
G@@ ene@@ tics , lifestyle and environment .
That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
Well , I understand the gene@@ tics and lifestyle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physici@@ ans constantly ask me questions about this .
Have you ever had to fill out those long , le@@ gal@@ -@@ size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your sur@@ gical history , your all@@ er@@ gy history ... did I forget any history ?
But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physici@@ ans really get this part of the equation .
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
Just think about that , you know , w@@ ander through your life thinking about this .
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
And where do you ex@@ pose y@@ ourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot; &quot; Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
And I don &apos;t w@@ ander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an exten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ ker .
Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
I started off in Scr@@ ant@@ on , Pennsylvan@@ ia .
I don &apos;t know if anybody might h@@ ail from nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern Pennsylvan@@ ia , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lun@@ gs .
You know , breathing high concentr@@ ations here of sul@@ fur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in un@@ equal quanti@@ ties — 19 years of this .
And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smo@@ l@@ dering coal waste look like .
So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-@@ west .
OK , so I ended up in Lou@@ is@@ ville , Ken@@ tu@@ ck@@ y .
Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called R@@ ub@@ ber@@ town .
They manu@@ fac@@ ture plas@@ tics . They use large quanti@@ ties ch@@ lor@@ o@@ pren@@ e and b@@ enz@@ ene .
Okay , I spent 25 years , in my midd@@ le-@@ age lun@@ gs now , breathing various concentr@@ ations of that .
And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
It was insi@@ di@@ ous and it was really happening .
Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Co@@ ast .
And I moved to Red@@ lands California .
Very nice , and there my older , sen@@ ior lun@@ gs , as I like to call them , I filled with particul@@ ate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of o@@ zone .
Okay ? Al@@ most like the highest in the nation .
Al@@ right , this is what it looks like on a good day .
If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ing@@ est into my stom@@ ach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
This data &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
Now , I &apos;ve cir@@ cl@@ ed the places where I &apos;ve been .
Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
So , how many people are in the white ?
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
Any@@ body ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are dis@@ played in at@@ las@@ es all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train w@@ rec@@ k .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
And it &apos;s not in yours either .
So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be trac@@ ked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 3@@ 65 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really studied that you might have some clu@@ es as to what Paul likes to do .
Any@@ body got any clu@@ es ? S@@ ki . Right .
We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release invent@@ ories that are monit@@ ored by the E@@ PA .
Did you know that data existed ?
For every community in the United States , you could have your own person@@ alized map of that .
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that ex@@ am room instead of just the pink sli@@ p that said I paid at the coun@@ ter . Right ?
This could be my little ass@@ ess@@ ment .
And he looks at that and he says , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;@@ clock at night .
I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescri@@ ptions .
Okay , number one is , we must teach physici@@ ans about the value of ge@@ ograph@@ ical information .
It &apos;s called geom@@ e@@ dic@@ ine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
But it will also be useful for us .
I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the o@@ zone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
Or I could negoti@@ ate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what the conclusion of the D@@ art@@ mouth Atl@@ as of He@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can explain the ge@@ ographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in well@@ ness , and how our healthcare system actually oper@@ ates .
That was what he was talking about on that quote .
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really se@@ ize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Ge@@ ography always matters .
And I believe that ge@@ ographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .

So I was trained to become a gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast for two years in Hun@@ an , China in the 197@@ 0s .
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for ath@@ let@@ es , all expen@@ ses paid .
But my ti@@ ger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
After survi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tural Revolution , they fir@@ m@@ ly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-@@ paid job .
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera sing@@ er .
That is me playing my imagin@@ ary piano .
An opera sing@@ er must start training young to learn acro@@ b@@ atic@@ s , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
But no adults liked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fair .
So I was determined to find another calling .
Nobody around to teach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to books .
I satis@@ fied my hunger for par@@ ental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ respon@@ dence in the F@@ am@@ ily of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tradition requires o@@ be@@ dience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Che@@ aper by the Do@@ zen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study ab@@ road after reading these .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ple@@ te Wor@@ ks of San@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( ak@@ a E@@ ch@@ o Ch@@ an ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons From H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; &quot; by N@@ an Hu@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
B@@ oo@@ ks bann@@ ed in China , of course .
&quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not conven@@ ient for propag@@ anda . G@@ ot it .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
But the fifth command@@ ment gave me an epi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Hon@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an guil@@ t tra@@ p and to rest@@ art my relationship with my parents .
En@@ counter@@ ing a new culture also started my habit of compar@@ ative reading .
It off@@ ers many insi@@ ghts .
For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually car@@ ries somebody &apos;s view .
Com@@ par@@ ative reading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
There are even research fields such as compar@@ ative religion and compar@@ ative literature .
Com@@ pare and contrast gives schol@@ ars a more complete understanding of a topic .
So I thought , well , if compar@@ ative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
So I started reading books in pairs .
So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Frank@@ lin &quot; &quot; by Wal@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John A@@ dam@@ s &quot; &quot; by David Mc@@ C@@ ull@@ ough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Per@@ s@@ onal H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; &quot; by K@@ ath@@ ar@@ ine G@@ ra@@ ham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The S@@ now@@ ball : War@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ ett and the Bus@@ iness of Life , &quot; &quot; by A@@ lice Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres — ( Laughter ) &#91; Ho@@ ly Bible : King James Ver@@ sion &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ am@@ b &quot; &quot; by Chris@@ opher Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Cam@@ p@@ b@@ ell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Po@@ wer of My@@ th &quot; &quot; by Joseph Cam@@ p@@ b@@ ell &#93; For example , both the Chris@@ t and the Bu@@ ddha went through three temp@@ tations .
For the Chris@@ t , the temp@@ tations are economic , political and spiritual .
For the Bu@@ ddha , they are all psychological : l@@ ust , fear and social du@@ ty — interesting .
So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The W@@ ay of C@@ hu@@ ang T@@ z@@ u &quot; &quot; Thomas Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ a@@ o : The W@@ ater@@ course W@@ ay &quot; &quot; Alan Wat@@ ts &#93; Instead of lost in trans@@ lation , I found there is much to gain .
For example , it &apos;s through trans@@ lation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Hu@@ h !
&quot; &quot; Bri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h-@@ oh .
( Laughter ) B@@ oo@@ ks have given me a magic port@@ al to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I shall never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
H@@ aving a dream sh@@ at@@ tered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
I@@ ts most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
Even a sh@@ at@@ tered dream can do that for you .
So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a cl@@ arity , most of the time .
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m an American , which means , generally , I ignore football unless it involves guys my size or Bruno &apos;s size running into each other at extremely high spe@@ eds .
That said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
I go onto Twitter , there are all these strange words that I &apos;ve never heard before : F@@ I@@ F@@ A , v@@ u@@ v@@ u@@ z@@ ela , weird jo@@ kes about oc@@ top@@ i .
But the one that &apos;s really been sort of str@@ essing me out , that I haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks , you &apos;ve probably seen this .
It &apos;s been a major tr@@ ending topic .
Be@@ ing a mon@@ ol@@ in@@ gu@@ al American , I obviously don &apos;t know what the phrase means .
So I went onto Twitter , and I asked some people if they could explain to me &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And fortunately , my Braz@@ ilian friends were more than ready to help .
They explained that the Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o bird is a rare and end@@ anger@@ ed par@@ ro@@ t that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
Narrator : A word about Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o , a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil .
Every year , more than 3@@ 00,000 Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o birds are killed during Car@@ ni@@ val par@@ ades .
E@@ than Z@@ uck@@ er@@ man : Obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
It turns out that , not only is the Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o par@@ ro@@ t very attractive , useful for head@@ dr@@ esses , it evid@@ ently has certain halluc@@ ino@@ gen@@ ic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o abuse .
Some sick and tw@@ isted people have found themselves s@@ nor@@ ting Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o .
And it &apos;s terri@@ bly end@@ anger@@ ed .
The good news about this is that the global community — again , my Braz@@ ilian friends tell me — is pit@@ ching in to help out .
It turns out that L@@ ady G@@ ag@@ a has released a new single — actually five or six new sing@@ les , as near as I can tell — ti@@ tled &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And my Braz@@ ilian friends tell me that if I just twe@@ et the phrase &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o , &quot; &quot; 10 cents will be given to a global campaign to save this rare and beautiful bird .
Now , most of you have figured out that this was a pr@@ ank , and actually a very , very good one .
&quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o &quot; &quot; actually means something very different .
In Portu@@ g@@ ese , it means &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ut your mouth , Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And it specifically ref@@ ers to this guy , Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o Bu@@ en@@ o , who &apos;s the lead so@@ c@@ cer comment@@ ator for Re@@ de Glob@@ o .
And what I understand from my Braz@@ ilian friends is that this guy is just a cli@@ che machine .
He can ru@@ in the most interesting match by just s@@ pou@@ ting cli@@ che again and again and again .
So Braz@@ ili@@ ans went to that first match against North Korea , put up this bann@@ er , started a Twitter campaign and tried to convince the rest of us to twe@@ et the phrase : &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , Gal@@ v@@ a@@ o . &quot; &quot; And in fact , were so successful at this that it top@@ ped Twitter for two weeks .
Now there &apos;s a couple — there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
And the first lesson , which I think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activis@@ m just means re@@ twe@@ eting a phrase .
So as long as activis@@ m is that simple , it &apos;s pretty easy to get away with .
The other thing you can take from this , by the way , is that there are a lot of Braz@@ ili@@ ans on Twitter .
There &apos;s more than five million of them .
As far as national representation , 11 percent of Braz@@ ilian internet users are on Twitter .
That &apos;s a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
Next to Japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
Now if you &apos;re using Twitter or other social networks , and you didn &apos;t realize this was a space with a lot of Braz@@ ili@@ ans in it , you &apos;re like most of us .
Because what happens on a social network is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with .
And if you are like me , a big , ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other ge@@ e@@ ky , white , American guys .
And you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that Twitter is in fact a very heav@@ ily Braz@@ ilian space .
It &apos;s also extremely surprising to many Americans , a heav@@ ily African-@@ American space .
Twitter recently did some research .
They looked at their local population .
They believe that 24 percent of American Twitter users are African-@@ American .
That &apos;s about twice as high as African-@@ Americans are represented in the population .
And again , that was very shoc@@ king to many Twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
And the reason it shouldn &apos;t be is that on any day you can go into T@@ rend@@ ing T@@ op@@ ics .
And you tend to find top@@ ics that are almost entirely African-@@ American conversations .
This was a visu@@ alization done by Fer@@ nan@@ do Vi@@ eg@@ as and Martin W@@ atten@@ berg , two amazing visu@@ alization designers , who looked at a week@@ end &apos;s worth of Twitter traffic and essentially found that a lot of these tr@@ ending top@@ ics were basically se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated conversations — and in ways that you wouldn &apos;t expect .
It turns out that oil sp@@ ill is a mostly white conversation , that co@@ ok@@ out is a mostly black conversation .
And what &apos;s crazy about this is that if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter , it &apos;s literally a quick click away .
You click on that co@@ ok@@ out tag , there an entirely different conversation with different people particip@@ ating in it .
But generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
We end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend El@@ i Par@@ iser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
And we tend not to see that wider picture .
Now for me , I &apos;m surprised by this , because this wasn &apos;t how the internet was supposed to be .
If you go back into the early days of the internet , when cyber@@ -@@ u@@ top@@ ians like Nick Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te were writing big books like &quot; &quot; Be@@ ing D@@ ig@@ ital , &quot; &quot; the prediction was that the internet was going to be an incredibly powerful force to smooth out cultural differences , to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another .
Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te started his book with a story about how hard it is to build connections in the world of atoms .
He &apos;s at a technology conference in Florida .
And he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absur@@ d , which is bot@@ tles of E@@ vi@@ an water on the table .
And Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te says this is crazy .
This is the old economy .
It &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
We &apos;re hea@@ ding to the future of bits , where everything is spe@@ e@@ dy , it &apos;s weigh@@ t@@ less .
It can be anywhere in the world at any time .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
Now , Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te has been right about a lot of things .
He &apos;s totally wrong about this one .
It turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
If I walk into a store in the United States , it &apos;s very , very easy for me to buy water that &apos;s bot@@ tled in Fi@@ j@@ i , shi@@ pped at great ex@@ pense to the United States .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly hard for me to see a Fi@@ j@@ ian feature film .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fi@@ j@@ ian music .
It &apos;s extremely difficult for me to get Fi@@ j@@ ian news , which is strange , because actually there &apos;s an enormous amount going on in Fi@@ j@@ i .
There &apos;s a coup government . There &apos;s a military government .
There &apos;s cr@@ ack@@ dow@@ ns on the press .
It &apos;s actually a place that we probably should be paying attention to at the moment .
Here &apos;s what I think is going on .
I think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
We look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world .
And that &apos;s a framework that includes things like air@@ line routes .
It includes things like the Internet c@@ ables .
We look at a map like this one , and it looks like the entire world is flat because everything is a hop or two away .
You can get on a flight in London , you can end up in Bang@@ alo@@ re later today .
Two hop@@ s , you &apos;re in Su@@ va , the capit@@ ol of Fi@@ j@@ i .
It &apos;s all right there .
When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
You start looking at how the global plane f@@ lights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
It &apos;s extremely l@@ um@@ p@@ y .
There are parts of the world that are very , very well connected .
There &apos;s basically a giant path@@ way in the sky between London and New York .
but look at this map , and you can watch this for , you know , two or three minutes .
You won &apos;t see very many planes go from South America to Africa .
And you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are system@@ atically cut off .
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
So here &apos;s the problem that I &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
The world is , in fact , getting more global .
It &apos;s getting more connected .
More of problems are global in scale .
More of our economics is global in scale .
And our media is less global by the day .
If you watched a television broad@@ cast in the United States in the 197@@ 0s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a ni@@ ghtly new broad@@ cast .
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
And this tends to give us a very dist@@ or@@ ted view of the world .
Here &apos;s a slide that Al@@ is@@ a M@@ iller showed at a previous TED Talk .
Al@@ is@@ a &apos;s the president of Public R@@ adi@@ o International .
And she made a carto@@ gram , which is basically a dist@@ or@@ ted map based on what American television news cas@@ ts looked at for a month .
And you see that when you dist@@ ort a map based on attention , the world within American television news is basically reduced to this giant blo@@ ated U.S.
and a couple of other countries which we &apos;ve inv@@ aded .
And that &apos;s basically what our media is about .
And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news — which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and I agree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful — I &apos;ve been m@@ apping elite media like the New York Times , and I get the same thing .
When you look at the New York Times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very weal@@ thy nations and the nations we &apos;ve inv@@ aded .
It turns out that new media isn &apos;t necessarily helping us all that much .
Here &apos;s a map made by Mark G@@ ra@@ ham who &apos;s down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute .
A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia that have been ge@@ o-@@ co@@ ded .
And you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a very heavy bias towards North America and Western Europe .
Even within Wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ as , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the Wikipedia auth@@ ors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
In the U.K. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia , from Canada , God for@@ bi@@ d from the U.S.
You probably won &apos;t .
If you look at online media consumption — in this case , in the top 10 users of the internet — more than 95 percent of the news read@@ er@@ ship is on domestic news sites .
It &apos;s one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than &#91; the U.K. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice vers@@ a .
So all of this starts leading me to think that we &apos;re in a state that I ref@@ er to as imagin@@ ary cosmo@@ polit@@ an@@ ism .
We look at the internet .
We think we &apos;re getting this wide view of the globe .
We occasi@@ onally st@@ um@@ ble onto a page in Chinese , and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built to connect us to the rest of the world .
And we forget that most of the time we &apos;re chec@@ king Boston Red So@@ x scores .
So this is a real problem — not just because the Red So@@ x are having a bad year — but it &apos;s a real problem because , as we &apos;re discus@@ sing here at TED , the real problems in the world the interesting problems to solve are global in scale and scope , they require global conversations to get to global solutions .
This is a problem we have to solve .
So here &apos;s the good news .
For six years , I &apos;ve been hanging out with these guys .
This is a group called Global Vo@@ ices .
This is a team of blo@@ gg@@ ers from around the world .
Our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
We started in 2004 .
You might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
N@@ or do I think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
But the more that I think about it , the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would re@@ wire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world .
The first thing you have to consider is that there are parts of the world that are dark spots in terms of attention .
In this case — the map of the world at night by NASA — they &apos;re dark literally because of lack of electricity .
And I used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you &apos;re not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs .
What I &apos;m starting to realize is that you can get media , it &apos;s just an enormous amount of work , and you need an enormous amount of encour@@ agement .
One of those dark spots is Mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car , a country which is generally better known for the D@@ re@@ am@@ works film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
And so the people who founded F@@ ok@@ o C@@ lu@@ b in Mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
They were doing something much simpl@@ er .
It was a club to learn English and to learn computers and the internet .
but what happened was that Mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car went through a violent coup .
Most independent media was shut down .
And the high school students who were learning to blog through F@@ ok@@ o C@@ lu@@ b suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience about the demonstr@@ ations , the violence , everything that was going on within this country .
So a very , very small program designed to get people in front of computers , publ@@ ishing their own thoughts , publ@@ ishing independent media , ended up having a huge impact on what we know about this country .
Now the trick with this is that I &apos;m gu@@ essing most people here don &apos;t speak Mal@@ ag@@ as@@ y .
I &apos;m also gu@@ essing that most of you don &apos;t even speak Chinese — which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
For@@ tunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this .
If you &apos;re using Google Chr@@ ome and you go to a Chinese language site , you notice this really cute box at the top , which automatically det@@ ects that the page is in Chinese and very quickly at a mouse click will give you a trans@@ lation of the page .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s a machine trans@@ lation of the page .
And while Google is very , very good with some languages , it &apos;s actually pretty dre@@ ad@@ ful with Chinese .
And the results can be pretty funny .
What you really want — what I really want , is eventually the ability to push a button and have this qu@@ eu@@ ed so a human being can translate this .
And if you think this is absur@@ d , it &apos;s not .
There &apos;s a group right now in China called Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an .
And Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an is a group of 15@@ 0,000 volunteers who get online every day .
They look for the most interesting content in the English language .
They translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major web@@ sites .
They put it online for free .
It &apos;s the project of a guy named Z@@ hang Le@@ i , who was living in the United States during the L@@ has@@ a ri@@ ots and who couldn &apos;t believe how bi@@ ased American media co@@ ver@@ age was .
And he said , &quot; &quot; If there &apos;s one thing I can do , I can start transl@@ ating , so that people between these countries start understanding each other a little bit better . &quot; &quot; And my question to you is : if Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an can line up 15@@ 0,000 people to translate the English internet into Chinese , where &apos;s the English language Y@@ e@@ ey@@ an ?
Who &apos;s going after Chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese , there &apos;s no guaran@@ tee that we &apos;re going to find it .
When we look for information online , we basically have two strategies .
We use a lot of search .
And search is terri@@ fic if you know what you &apos;re looking for .
But if what you &apos;re looking for is ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , if you want to st@@ um@@ ble onto something that you didn &apos;t know you needed , our main philosophy is to look to our social networks , to look for our friends .
What are they looking at ? Maybe we should be looking at it .
The problem with this is that essentially what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the f@@ lock .
You end up f@@ loc@@ king with a lot of people who are probably similar to you , who have similar interests .
And it &apos;s very , very hard to get information from the other f@@ loc@@ ks , from the other parts of the world where people getting together and talking about their own interests .
To do this , at a certain point , you need someone to bum@@ p you out of your f@@ lock and into another f@@ lock .
You need a guide .
So this is A@@ mi@@ ra Al H@@ us@@ s@@ ain@@ i . She is the Middle East edit@@ or for Global Vo@@ ices .
She has one of the hard@@ est jobs in the world .
Not only does she have to keep our Israel@@ i and Palestin@@ ian contribu@@ tors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the Middle East .
And in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of R@@ am@@ ad@@ an , she has to know something about a global audience .
She has to know something about what stories are available .
Basically , she &apos;s a dee@@ j@@ ay .
She &apos;s a sk@@ illed human cur@@ ator who knows what material is available to her , who &apos;s able to listen to the audience , and who &apos;s able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another .
I don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorith@@ mic process .
I think what &apos;s great about the internet is that it actually makes it much easier for dee@@ j@@ ays to reach a wider audience .
I know A@@ mi@@ ra .
I can ask her what to read .
But with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
And you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web wid@@ ened .
So once you start wid@@ ening like this , once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots , once you start transl@@ ating , once you start cur@@ ating , you end up in some really weird places .
This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog , which is Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get .
And Afri@@ G@@ ad@@ get is a blog that looks at technology in an Africa context .
And specifically , it &apos;s looking at a black@@ sm@@ ith in Ki@@ ber@@ a in Nairobi , who is turning the sh@@ af@@ t of a L@@ and@@ ro@@ ver into a cold ch@@ is@@ el .
And when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; Why would I conce@@ iv@@ ably care about this ? &quot;
And the truth is , this guy can probably explain this to you .
This is Eri@@ k Her@@ sm@@ an . You guys may have seen him around the conference .
He goes by the mon@@ i@@ ker White African .
He &apos;s both a very well known American ge@@ ek , but he &apos;s also Ken@@ yan ; he was born in Su@@ d@@ an , grew up in Kenya .
He is a bridge figure .
He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds — one in the world of the African technology community , one in the world of the American technology community .
And so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this black@@ sm@@ ith in Ki@@ ber@@ a and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about innov@@ ating from constr@@ aint , about looking for inspiration based on re@@ using materials .
He knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
These bridge figures , I &apos;m pretty well convinced , are the future of how we try to make the world wider through using the web .
But the trick with bri@@ dges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
And that &apos;s where we start talking about x@@ en@@ ophi@@ les .
So if I found myself in the N@@ F@@ L , I suspect I would spend my off@@ -@@ season nur@@ sing my w@@ ounds , enjo@@ ying my house , so on and so forth — possibly recording a hi@@ p-@@ hop album .
D@@ han@@ i Jones , who is the middle lin@@ e@@ back@@ er for the C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i B@@ eng@@ als , has a slightly different approach to the off@@ -@@ season .
D@@ han@@ i has a television show .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ han@@ i T@@ ack@@ les the G@@ lobe . &quot; &quot; And every week on this television show , D@@ han@@ i trav@@ els to a different nation of the world .
He finds a local s@@ porting team .
He trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
And his reason for this is not just that he wants to master Mu@@ ay Th@@ ai box@@ ing .
It &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full wid@@ th and wonder of the world .
For some of us it might be music . For some of us it might be food .
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
But there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
The goal of my Talk here is not to persu@@ ade the people in this room to embrace your x@@ en@@ oph@@ il@@ ia .
My guess — given that you &apos;re at a conference called TED@@ Global — is that most of you are x@@ en@@ ophi@@ les , whether or not you use that term .
My challenge instead is this .
It &apos;s not enough to make the personal decision that you want a wider world .
We have to figure out how to re@@ wire the systems that we have .
We have to fix our media .
We have to fix the internet . We have to fix our education .
We have to fix our immigr@@ ation policy .
We need to look at ways of creating ser@@ en@@ di@@ p@@ ity , of making trans@@ lation per@@ vas@@ ive , and we need to find ways to embrace and celebrate these bridge figures .
And we need to figure out how to cultiv@@ ate x@@ en@@ ophi@@ les .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do . I need your help .
( Applause )
Basically , there &apos;s a major dem@@ ographic event going on .
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic ti@@ pping point . So the world now is a map of connec@@ tivity .
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities .
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West . That &apos;s over .
The aggre@@ gate numbers are overwhel@@ ming .
So what &apos;s really going on ? Well , villages of the world are emp@@ t@@ ying out .
The question is , why ?
And here &apos;s the un@@ roman@@ tic truth — and the city air makes you free , they said in Ren@@ aissance Germany . So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where aes@@ the@@ tics rule .
And these are not really a people op@@ pressed by poverty .
They &apos;re people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .
They &apos;re the dominant buil@@ ders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
They have hom@@ e-@@ bre@@ wed infrastructure and vibr@@ ant urban life .
O@@ ne-@@ six@@ th of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai .
They are constantly up@@ grad@@ ing , and in a few cases , the government helps .
E@@ ducation is the main event that can happen in cities .
What &apos;s going on in the street in Mumbai ?
Al Gore knows . It &apos;s basically everything .
There &apos;s no un@@ employment in squ@@ at@@ ter cities . Everyone works .
O@@ ne-@@ six@@ th of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
So here &apos;s the first p@@ unch line : cities have def@@ used the population bomb .
And here &apos;s the second p@@ unch line .
That &apos;s the news from down@@ town . Here it is in perspective .
St@@ ars have sh@@ ined down on earth &apos;s life for billions of years .
Now we &apos;re sh@@ ining right back up .
Thank you .
The night before I was hea@@ ding for Scot@@ land , I was invited to host the final of &quot; &quot; China &apos;s G@@ ot Tal@@ ent &quot; &quot; show in Shanghai with the 8@@ 0,000 live audience in the st@@ adi@@ um .
Gu@@ ess who was the performing gu@@ est ?
Sus@@ an B@@ oy@@ le .
And I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to Scot@@ land the next day . &quot; &quot; She sang beauti@@ fully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送@@ 你@@ 葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; &quot; hel@@ lo &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; thank you , &quot; &quot; that ordinary stuff .
It means &quot; &quot; green on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; Why did she say that ?
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Sus@@ an B@@ oy@@ le — a 5@@ 0-@@ some year-old woman , a veget@@ able vend@@ or in Shanghai , who lo@@ ves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Ital@@ ian , so she managed to fill in the ly@@ r@@ ics with veget@@ able names in Chinese .
( Laughter ) And the last sentence of N@@ es@@ sun D@@ or@@ ma that she was singing in the st@@ adi@@ um was &quot; &quot; green on@@ ion for free . &quot; &quot; So &#91; as &#93; Sus@@ an B@@ oy@@ le was saying that , 8@@ 0,000 live audience sang together .
That was hil@@ ari@@ ous .
So I guess both Sus@@ an B@@ oy@@ le and this veget@@ able vend@@ or in Shanghai bel@@ ong@@ ed to other@@ ness .
They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
Well , being different is not that difficult .
We are all different from different perspectives .
But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
You may have the chance to make a difference .
My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was gradu@@ ating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-@@ star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sher@@ at@@ on — it &apos;s still there .
So after being interro@@ g@@ ated by this Japanese man@@ ager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; &quot; So , M@@ iss Y@@ ang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot; &quot; I sum@@ mon@@ ed my courage and po@@ ise and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have a clu@@ e what a sales department was about in a five-@@ star hotel .
That was the first day I set my foot in a five-@@ star hotel .
Ar@@ ound the same time , I was going through an audi@@ tion — the first ever open audi@@ tion by national television in China — with another thousand college girls .
The produc@@ er told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s person@@ alities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , sup@@ por@@ tive ?
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot; &quot; I thought I kind of off@@ ended them .
But actually , they were im@@ pressed by my words .
And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
After seven r@@ ounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
So I was on a national television prim@@ e-@@ time show .
And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its ho@@ sts to speak out of their own minds without reading an appro@@ ved script .
( Applause ) And my wee@@ kly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Colum@@ bia University to pursu@@ e my post@@ graduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was un@@ thought of during the years that I started my career .
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve intervie@@ wed more than a thousand people in the past .
And sometimes I have young people approach@@ ing me say , &quot; &quot; L@@ an , you changed my life , &quot; &quot; and I feel proud of that .
But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
I was in Beijing &apos;s bi@@ dding for the Olym@@ pic G@@ ames .
I was repres@@ enting the Shanghai Ex@@ p@@ o .
I saw China embrac@@ ing the world and vice vers@@ a .
But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
Well this is a girl called Gu@@ o Me@@ im@@ e@@ i — 20 years old , beautiful .
She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her micro@@ blog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
And she cl@@ aimed to be the general man@@ ager of Red Cro@@ ss at the Ch@@ am@@ ber of Com@@ mer@@ ce .
She didn &apos;t realize that she ste@@ pped on a sensitive nerve and ar@@ ous@@ ed national ques@@ tioning , almost a tur@@ mo@@ il , against the cre@@ di@@ bility of Red Cro@@ ss .
The controvers@@ y was so he@@ ated that the Red Cro@@ ss had to open a press conference to cl@@ ari@@ fy it , and the investi@@ gation is going on .
So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title — probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
All those expensive it@@ ems were given to her as gi@@ f@@ ts by her boy@@ friend , who used to be a board member in a sub@@ division of Red Cro@@ ss at Ch@@ am@@ ber of Com@@ mer@@ ce .
It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
It is still bo@@ iling .
It shows us a general mis@@ trust of government or govern@@ ment@@ -@@ b@@ acked institutions , which l@@ acked transparency in the past .
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as micro@@ blog .
Micro@@ blog bo@@ om@@ ed in the year of 2010 , with visit@@ ors doubl@@ ed and time spent on it tri@@ pled .
Sin@@ a@@ .com , a major news port@@ al , alone has more than 140 million micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ers .
On T@@ enc@@ ent , 200 million .
The most popular blo@@ gg@@ er — it &apos;s not me — it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million fol@@ lowers , or f@@ ans .
About 80 percent of those micro@@ blo@@ gg@@ ers are young people , under 30 years old .
And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heav@@ ily controlled by the government , social media off@@ ers an opening to let the stea@@ m out a little bit .
But because you don &apos;t have many other open@@ ings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
So through micro@@ blo@@ gging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
So how are they different ?
First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-@@ child policy .
And because of sel@@ ected abor@@ tion by families who fav@@ ored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a glob@@ alized world , so they can look for gir@@ l@@ friends from other countries .
Most of them have fairly good education .
The ill@@ iter@@ acy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with sev@@ en-@@ poin@@ t-@@ some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the el@@ ders financi@@ ally , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
So it means young cou@@ ples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 7@@ 3 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
College gradu@@ ates are not in short supply .
In urban areas , college gradu@@ ates find the starting sal@@ ary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
So what do they do ? They have to share space — squ@@ ee@@ zed in very limited space to save money — and they call themselves &quot; &quot; tri@@ be of ants . &quot; &quot; And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the sky@@ rock@@ eting real estate price .
A@@ mon@@ g the 200 million migr@@ ant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
They find themselves sort of sand@@ wi@@ ched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but they don &apos;t have the sense of bel@@ ong@@ ing .
They work for longer hours with less income , less social wel@@ fare .
And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job lo@@ sses , subject to inflation , ti@@ ghten@@ ing lo@@ ans from banks , appreci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ b@@ i , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
Last year , though , an app@@ all@@ ing incident in a southern O@@ EM manufacturing com@@ pound in China : 13 young workers in their late te@@ ens and early 20@@ s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contag@@ ious disease .
But they died because of all different personal reasons .
But this whole incident ar@@ ous@@ ed a huge out@@ cry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migr@@ ant workers .
For those who do return back to the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , they find themselves very welcome loc@@ ally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , up@@ grade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
So for the past few years , the co@@ as@@ tal areas , they found themselves in a shor@@ tage of labor .
These diagr@@ ams show a more general social background .
The first one is the En@@ g@@ els co@@ efficient , which explains that the cost of daily nec@@ essi@@ ties has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 3@@ 7@@ -@@ some percent .
But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , indic@@ ating a rising living cost .
The G@@ ini co@@ efficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.@@ 4 .
Now it &apos;s 0.@@ 5 — even worse than that in America — showing us the income inequality .
And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
And also , the bit@@ tern@@ ess and even res@@ ent@@ ment towards the rich and the powerful is quite wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad .
So any accus@@ ations of corruption or back@@ door de@@ al@@ ings between auth@@ orities or business would ar@@ ou@@ se a social out@@ cry or even un@@ rest .
So through some of the hot@@ test top@@ ics on micro@@ blo@@ gging , we can see what young people care most about .
Social justice and government accoun@@ tability runs the first in what they demand .
For the past decade or so , a massive urban@@ ization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demo@@ li@@ tion of private property .
And it has ar@@ ous@@ ed huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to prot@@ est .
So when these in@@ cidents are reported more and more frequ@@ ently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
So the good news is that earlier this year , the state coun@@ cil passed a new regul@@ ation on house requ@@ is@@ ition and demo@@ li@@ tion and passed the right to order forced demo@@ li@@ tion from local governments to the court .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , many other issues concer@@ ning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
We heard about pollu@@ ted air , pollu@@ ted water , pois@@ oned food .
And guess what , we have fa@@ ked be@@ ef .
They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ ef .
And then l@@ ately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; re@@ fin@@ ing &#93; cooking oil from restaurant s@@ lo@@ p .
So all these things have ar@@ ous@@ ed a huge out@@ cry from the Internet .
And fortunately , we have seen the government respon@@ ding more tim@@ ely and also more frequ@@ ently to the public concer@@ ns .
While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
as the number one market for lux@@ ury br@@ ands — that &apos;s not including the Chinese ex@@ pend@@ itures in Europe and elsewhere .
But you know what , half of those consumers are ear@@ ning a sal@@ ary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
They &apos;re not rich at all .
They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
And this is a girl explic@@ it@@ ly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a B@@ MW than smile on a bicycle .
But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a B@@ MW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; we@@ dding , or &quot; &quot; naked &quot; &quot; marriage .
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the we@@ dding , but it shows that these young cou@@ ples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diam@@ ond ring and without a we@@ dding ban@@ quet , to show their commitment to true love .
And also , people are doing good through social media .
And the first picture showed us that a truck c@@ aging 500 hom@@ eless and kidn@@ apped dogs for food processing was spo@@ t@@ ted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through micro@@ blo@@ gging .
People were don@@ ating money , dog food and off@@ ering volunte@@ er work to stop that truck .
And after hours of negoti@@ ation , 500 dogs were res@@ cu@@ ed .
And here also people are helping to find missing children .
A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
After thousands of res@@ ends in rel@@ ay , the child was found , and we witn@@ essed the re@@ uni@@ on of the family through micro@@ blo@@ gging .
So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
H@@ app@@ iness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
And also , how capable is the system of self-@@ correc@@ t@@ ness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
This back here was my brain cancer .
Isn &apos;t it nice ?
( Laughter ) The key phrase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; ph@@ ew .
( Applause ) H@@ aving brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , shoc@@ king news for me .
Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : Your images , your exam@@ s , your lab values , a list of medic@@ ines .
Doc@@ tors start speaking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease , instead of with the human being .
Can I study ? Can I make love ? Can I be creative ?
And you wonder , &quot; &quot; What have I done to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I change something about my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I do something ?
But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is tor@@ ture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who wai@@ ts . &quot;
But instead , you &apos;re forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
I talked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me .
There &apos;s more to me .
A cure , wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospital against medical advice .
I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dr@@ as@@ tic as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
So my best bet was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be acc@@ essed by anyone .
So I created a website , which is called La Cur@@ a , on which I put my medical data , online .
I actually had to h@@ ack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
( Laughter ) I chose this word , La Cur@@ a — La Cur@@ a in Ital@@ ian means &quot; &quot; the cure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things .
In our Western cultures , it means eradic@@ ating or re@@ vers@@ ing a disease , but in different cultures , for example , a culture from Asia , from the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an , from Latin countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things .
Of course , I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare provi@@ ders , but I was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians .
I was interested in the social cure , I was interested in the psychological cure , I was interested in the spiritual cure , I was interested in the emotional cure , I was interested in any form of cure .
And , it worked .
The La Cur@@ a website went viral .
I received lots of media attention from Italy and from ab@@ road and I quickly received more than 5@@ 00,000 contacts — emails , social net@@ working — most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer , but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual .
For example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art performances were produced for La Cur@@ a .
For example , here we see Franc@@ esc@@ a Fin@@ i in her performance .
Or , as artist P@@ atr@@ ick Li@@ ch@@ ty has done : He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ verse .
And together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
And the current strategy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
&#91; Sur@@ g@@ ery &#93; The fol@@ low-@@ up MR@@ Is showed , luc@@ kily , little to no growth of the cancer .
So I was able to take my time and choose .
I chose the doctor I wanted to work with , I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in , and in the mean@@ while , I was supported by thousands of people , none of whom felt p@@ ity for me .
What are the outcomes ?
I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
Everything I did was thou@@ ght@@ fully designed to get me engaged .
Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery , which was very intense , a matrix of electro@@ des was implan@@ ted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
Obviously , there were .
&#91; O@@ pen &#93; And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cur@@ a .
Th@@ ou@@ sands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
Doc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usually consul@@ t when they think about cancer .
I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ ounding , continuous state of trans@@ lation among many different languages , in which science me@@ ets emotion and conventional research me@@ ets traditional research .
&#91; Soci@@ ety &#93; The most important thing of La Cur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose well@@ ness really depends on the well@@ ness of all of its components .
This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
And from what I feel , it &apos;s a cure for me , but for us all .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
A big challenge is , how should the iP@@ ads be used , and what app@@ s should we put on the iP@@ ads ?
I write children &apos;s books , and there &apos;s a quote from P@@ abl@@ o Pic@@ as@@ so , &quot; &quot; We all know that Art is not truth .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; P@@ he@@ w , ph@@ ew , cal@@ m down . Get back into my body now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) U@@ su@@ ally when I play out , the first thing that happens is people scre@@ am out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; What &apos;s she doing ? ! What &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
And then I &apos;ll kind of be like — ( V@@ v@@ v@@ w@@ ow ! ) — and then they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m sure you &apos;re trying to figure out , &quot; Well , how does this thing work ? &quot;
Well , what I &apos;m doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .
See , the closer I get to this anten@@ na , the higher the note gets — ( Por@@ t@@ amen@@ to ) — and you can get it really low .
And with this hand I &apos;m controlling the volume , so the further away my right hand gets , the lou@@ der it gets .
( T@@ ones ) So basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continu@@ ously going ...
( Fl@@ our@@ ish ... Be@@ ep ) ( Laughter ) Sometimes I star@@ tle myself : I &apos;ll forget that I have it on , and I &apos;ll le@@ an over to pick up something , and then it goes like — ( B@@ li@@ p ) — &quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that fol@@ lows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off . ( Laughter )
Maybe we &apos;ll go into the next tune , because I totally lost where this is going .
We &apos;re going to do a song by David M@@ ash called &quot; &quot; L@@ isten : the Wor@@ ds Are G@@ one , &quot; &quot; and maybe I &apos;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can rel@@ ax .
( Music ) ( Applause ) So , I &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are common@@ ly asked ; there are so many .
And ... Well , I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the ther@@ em@@ in .
It was invented around the 19@@ 20@@ s , and the invent@@ or , L@@ é@@ on Th@@ er@@ em@@ in — he also was a musici@@ an besides an invent@@ or — he came up with the idea for making the ther@@ em@@ in , I think , when he was working on some shor@@ tw@@ ave radios .
And there &apos;d be that sound in the signal — it &apos;s like ( S@@ cre@@ e@@ ching ) — and he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument , because there are pit@@ ches in it . &quot; &quot; And so somehow through developing that , he eventually came to make the ther@@ em@@ in the way it is now .
And a lot of times , even kids now@@ ad@@ ays , they &apos;ll make reference to a ther@@ em@@ in by going , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ oo@@ -@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o , &quot; &quot; because in the &apos; 5@@ 0s it was used in the sci@@ -@@ fi hor@@ ror movies , that sound that &apos;s like ... ( Woo@@ -@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o-@@ ho@@ o ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s kind of a funny , go@@ of@@ y sound to do .
And sometimes if I have too much coffee , then my vibr@@ a@@ to gets out of hand .
You &apos;re really sensitive to your body and its functions when you &apos;re behind this thing .
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .
It reminds me of the bal@@ ancing act earlier on — what Michael was doing — because you &apos;re fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you &apos;re playing with and stay in tune , and at the same time you don &apos;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ; you want to be feeling the music .
And then also , you &apos;re trying to stay very , very , very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch , or sometimes if you &apos;re holding a low note — ( T@@ one rising out of key ) — and breathing will make it ...
( Laughter ) If I pass out on the next song ... ( Laughter )
I think of it almost like like a yo@@ ga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
And if I go to a club and play a gi@@ g , people are like , &quot; Here , have some dr@@ in@@ ks on us ! &quot;
And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m about to go on soon ; I don &apos;t want to be like — ( Te@@ et@@ ering t@@ ones ) — you know ? &quot; &quot; It really does reflect the mo@@ od that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ...
it &apos;s similar to being a voc@@ alist , except instead of it coming out of your thro@@ at , you &apos;re controlling it just in the air and you don &apos;t really have a point of reference ; you &apos;re always rel@@ ying on your ears and ad@@ just@@ ing constantly .
You just have to always ad@@ just to what &apos;s happening and realize you &apos;ll have bum@@ mer notes come here and there and listen to it , ad@@ just it , and just move on , or else you &apos;ll get too tied up and go crazy . Like me .
I think we will play another tune now .
I &apos;m going to do &quot; &quot; L@@ ush Life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of my favorite tu@@ nes to play .
( Music ) ( Applause )
It has been 1@@ 28 years since the last country in the world abol@@ ished slavery and 5@@ 3 years since Martin Luther King pron@@ ounc@@ ed his &quot; &quot; I Have A D@@ re@@ am &quot; &quot; speech .
But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression , but a las@@ ting one that remains .
I was born in a family full of colors .
My father is the son of a m@@ aid from whom he inher@@ ited an intense dark chocolate tone .
He was adopted by those who I know as my grand@@ parents .
The matri@@ ar@@ ch , my grand@@ ma , has a por@@ cel@@ ain skin and cot@@ t@@ on-@@ like hair .
My mother is a cin@@ nam@@ on-@@ skin daughter of a native Braz@@ ilian , with a pin@@ ch of h@@ az@@ el and hon@@ ey , and a man &#91; who is &#93; a mix of coffee with milk , but with a lot of coffee .
She has two sisters .
One in a to@@ as@@ te@@ d-@@ pe@@ an@@ ut skin and the other , also adopted , more on the be@@ ige side , like a p@@ anc@@ ake .
( Laughter ) Gro@@ wing up in this family , color was never important for me .
Ou@@ t@@ side home , however , things were different soon .
C@@ olo@@ r had many other mean@@ ings .
I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory feelings .
It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique fl@@ es@@ h-@@ colo@@ red pen@@ cil .
I was made of fl@@ esh but I wasn &apos;t pink .
My skin was brown , and people said I was black .
I was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head .
L@@ ater , when I took my cousin to school , I was usually taken for the n@@ anny .
By helping in the kitchen at a friend &apos;s party , people thought I was the m@@ aid .
I was even treated like a pro@@ stitu@@ te just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends .
And many times , vis@@ iting my grand@@ ma or friends in upper class buildings , I was invited not to use the main elev@@ ator .
Because in the end , with this color and this hair , I cannot bel@@ ong to some places .
In some way , I get to used to it and accept part of it .
However , something inside of me keeps re@@ vol@@ ving and struggling .
Y@@ ears later I married a Span@@ i@@ ard .
But not any Span@@ i@@ ard .
I chose one with the skin color of a lob@@ ster when sun@@ bur@@ n@@ t .
( Laughter ) Since then , a new question started to chase me .
What will be the color of your children ?
But thinking about it , with my previous background , my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer .
And that is how Hum@@ an@@ ae was born .
Hum@@ an@@ ae is a pur@@ suit to high@@ light our true colors , rather than the un@@ true white , red , black or yellow associated with race .
It &apos;s a kind of game to question our codes .
It &apos;s a work in progress from a personal story to a global history .
I por@@ tr@@ ay the subjects in a white background .
Then I choose an 11@@ -@@ pix@@ el square from the nose , paint the background , and look for the correspon@@ ding color in the industrial pal@@ ette , P@@ ant@@ one .
I started with my family and friends , then more and more people joined the adventure , thanks to public calls coming through the social media .
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that inv@@ ites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain .
The s@@ now@@ ball started to roll .
The project had a great welcome — inv@@ itations , exhi@@ bi@@ tions , physical form@@ ats , gall@@ eries and mus@@ eu@@ ms ...
just happened .
And among them , my favorite : when Hum@@ an@@ ae occu@@ pies public spaces and appears in the street , it fo@@ sters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community .
I have por@@ tr@@ ayed more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries , 19 different cities around the world .
Just to mention some of them — from someone included in the For@@ bes list , to refugees who cross@@ ed the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an by boat .
In Paris , from the U@@ N@@ ES@@ C@@ O H@@ ea@@ d@@ quarters to a shelter .
And students both in S@@ wit@@ zer@@ land and fav@@ elas in Rio de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o .
All kinds of beliefs , gender identi@@ ties or physical imp@@ air@@ ments , a new@@ born or termin@@ ally ill .
We all together build Hum@@ an@@ ae .
Those portraits make us re@@ think how we see each other .
When modern science is ques@@ tioning the race concept , what does it mean for us to be black , white , yellow , red ?
Is it the eye , the nose , the mouth , the hair ?
Or does it have to do with our origin , nation@@ ality or bank account ?
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery .
Su@@ dd@@ enly I realized that Hum@@ an@@ ae was useful for many people .
It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves refl@@ ected in any lab@@ el .
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me .
I have hundreds of that , I will share with you , too .
A mother of 11 years — A mother of an 11@@ -year-old girl wrote me , &quot; &quot; Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence , as this past week@@ end one of her gir@@ l@@ friends argu@@ ed with her that she does not bel@@ ong and should not be allowed to live in Norway .
So your work has a very special place in my heart and it &apos;s very important for me . &quot; &quot; A woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote , &quot; &quot; All my life , people from across the globe had difficul@@ ties to place me in a group , a stere@@ oty@@ pe , a box .
Perhaps we should stop .
I &apos;m a D@@ omin@@ ic@@ an-@@ D@@ ut@@ ch , I grew up in a mixed family and I &apos;m a bis@@ exu@@ al woman . &apos; &quot; &quot; B@@ es@@ ides these unexpected and tou@@ ching re@@ actions , Hum@@ an@@ ae finds a new life in a different variety of fields .
Just to show you some examples , illustr@@ ators and art students using it as a reference for their sket@@ ches and their studies .
It &apos;s a collection of faces .
Res@@ ear@@ chers in the fields of anthropo@@ logy , physics and neuroscience use Hum@@ an@@ ae with different scientific approaches related to human eth@@ n@@ icity , op@@ top@@ hy@@ si@@ ology , face recognition or Alzheimer &apos;s .
One of the most important impacts of the project is that Hum@@ an@@ ae was chosen to be the cover of F@@ ore@@ ign A@@ ff@@ airs , one of the most relevant political public@@ ations .
And talking about foreign aff@@ airs , I found the perfect ambass@@ ad@@ ors for my project ...
teachers .
They are the ones that use Hum@@ an@@ ae as a tool for educational pur@@ poses .
Their passion encour@@ ages me to go back to drawing classes , but this time as a teacher myself .
My students , both adults and kids , paint their self-@@ portraits , trying to discover their own unique color .
As a photographer , I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate .
As an individual , as An@@ gé@@ lic@@ a , every time I take a picture , I feel that I am sitting in front of a therap@@ ist .
All the frustration , fear and lon@@ el@@ iness that I once felt ...
becomes love .
The last country — the last country in the world who abol@@ ished slavery is the country where I was born , Brazil .
That remains a common practice worldwide , and that will not disappear by itself .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
I &apos;ve been so im@@ pressed by the kind@@ ness ex@@ pressed to me .
I called my wife Les@@ lie , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of ang@@ els . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a true feeling .
But let me get to the talk — I see the clock is running .
I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my super@@ int@@ end@@ ent .
Her name is P@@ am Mor@@ an in Al@@ b@@ em@@ ar@@ le Coun@@ ty , Virgin@@ ia , the fo@@ oth@@ ills of the Blue Ri@@ dge Mount@@ ains .
And she &apos;s a very high-tech super@@ int@@ end@@ ent .
She uses smart boards , she blogs , she T@@ we@@ ets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
She &apos;s a technology leader and instruc@@ tional leader .
But in her office , there &apos;s this old woo@@ den , wea@@ ther@@ -@@ wor@@ n table , kitchen table — pe@@ eling green paint , it &apos;s kind of r@@ ick@@ ety .
And I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ am , you &apos;re such a modern , cut@@ t@@ ing-@@ edge person .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot; &quot; And she told me , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , I grew up in Sou@@ th@@ w@@ estern Virgin@@ ia , in the coal mines and the farm@@ lands of rural Virgin@@ ia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plo@@ wing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insi@@ ghts and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot; &quot; The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace G@@ ame , and essentially it is also an empty space .
And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
It all started back in 197@@ 7 .
I was a young man , and I had been dro@@ pping in and out of college .
And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing inter@@ mit@@ tent so@@ jour@@ ns to India on a my@@ s@@ tical quest .
And I remember the last time I came back from India — in my long white flowing ro@@ bes and my big be@@ ard and my John L@@ enn@@ on glasses — and I said to my father , &quot; D@@ ad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so they plea@@ ded with me to get a degree in something .
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
It was an experimental education program .
It could have been denti@@ str@@ y , but the word &quot; &quot; experimental &quot; &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
And I went in for a job interview in the Rich@@ mon@@ d Public S@@ cho@@ ols in Virgin@@ ia , the capital city , bought a three-@@ piece suit — my conc@@ ession to con@@ vention — kept my long be@@ ard and my a@@ fr@@ o and my platform shoes — at the time it was the &apos; 70s — and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the super@@ vis@@ or , her name was An@@ na Ar@@ o , said I had the job teaching gi@@ f@@ ted children .
And I was so shoc@@ ked , so stun@@ ned , I got up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Gi@@ f@@ ted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And her answer shoc@@ ked me . It stun@@ ned me .
Her answer set the t@@ empl@@ ate for the entire career I was to have after that .
She said , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And that question clear@@ ed the space .
There was no program direc@@ tive , no manu@@ al to follow , no standards in gi@@ f@@ ted education in that way .
And she clear@@ ed such a space that I end@@ e@@ av@@ ored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , wh@@ ere@@ by they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
So this happened in 197@@ 8 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young film@@ maker .
His name is Chris Far@@ ina .
Chris Far@@ ina is here today at his own cost .
Chris , could you stand up and let them see you — a young , visi@@ on@@ ary film@@ maker who &apos;s made a film .
( Applause ) This film is called &quot; &quot; World Peace and Other 4@@ th G@@ ra@@ de A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ements . &quot; &quot; He pro@@ posed the film to me — it &apos;s a great title .
He pro@@ posed the film to me , and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot; &quot; But the film has really gone places .
Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a test@@ ament to teaching and teachers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
And the strange thing is , when I watch the film — I have the e@@ erie sensation of seeing it — I saw myself literally disappear .
What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
I saw my geom@@ etry teacher in high school , Mr. R@@ uc@@ ell &apos;s wr@@ y smile under his hand@@ le@@ bar mu@@ st@@ ache .
That &apos;s the smile I use — that &apos;s his smile .
I saw J@@ an Pol@@ o &apos;s flash@@ ing eyes .
And they weren &apos;t flash@@ ing in anger , they were flash@@ ing in love , intense love for her students .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
And I saw M@@ iss E@@ the@@ l J@@ . B@@ anks who w@@ ore pe@@ ar@@ ls and high-@@ he@@ els to el@@ ement@@ ary school every day .
And you know , she had that ol@@ d-@@ school teacher st@@ are .
You know the one .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know that teacher ?
I didn &apos;t use that st@@ are very often , but I do have it in my re@@ per@@ toire .
And M@@ iss B@@ anks was there as a great mentor for me .
And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
My father , very inventi@@ ve , spatial thin@@ ker .
That &apos;s my brother Mal@@ col@@ m there on the right .
And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated schools in Virgin@@ ia , who was my inspiration .
And really , I feel as though , when I see the film — I have a ges@@ ture she does , like this — I feel like I am a continu@@ ation of her ges@@ ture .
I am one of her teaching ges@@ tures .
And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in el@@ ement@@ ary school , Mad@@ eline .
And so that ges@@ ture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lin@@ e@@ age .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoul@@ ders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this World Peace G@@ ame I &apos;d like to tell you about .
It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-@@ foot by five-@@ foot pl@@ y@@ wood board in an in@@ ner@@ -@@ city urban school , 197@@ 8 .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
I wanted to have them be immer@@ sed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
I &apos;ll make something — I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 197@@ 8 — but something interactive .
And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-@@ foot by four-@@ foot by four-@@ foot Pl@@ exig@@ l@@ ass structure .
And it has four Pl@@ exig@@ l@@ ass layers .
There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and aster@@ oid mining .
There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big pu@@ ff@@ s of cot@@ ton we push around and territ@@ orial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it — even an under@@ sea level with sub@@ mar@@ ines and under@@ sea mining .
There are four countries around the board .
The kids make up the names of the countries — some are rich ; some are poor .
They have different assets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cab@@ inet .
There &apos;s a Pri@@ me Min@@ ister , Sec@@ ret@@ ary of State , Min@@ ister of De@@ fen@@ se and a C@@ F@@ O , or Com@@ p@@ tr@@ oll@@ er .
I choose the Pri@@ me Min@@ ister based on my relationship with them .
I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cab@@ inet .
There &apos;s a World Bank , arms de@@ al@@ ers and a United Nations .
There &apos;s also a weather go@@ dd@@ ess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 13@@ -@@ page crisis document with 50 inter@@ loc@@ king problems .
So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
And so with all these crises , we have — let &apos;s see — ethni@@ c and min@@ ority ten@@ sions ; we have chemical and nuclear sp@@ ills , nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation .
There &apos;s oil sp@@ ills , environmental dis@@ as@@ ters , water rights dispu@@ tes , break@@ away re@@ publics , famine , end@@ anger@@ ed species and global warming .
If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my four@@ th-@@ grad@@ ers from Ag@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t and Ven@@ able schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they &apos;ve done it several times too . ( Laughter )
So I also have in the game a s@@ ab@@ ot@@ eur — some child — it &apos;s basically a trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker — and I have my trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
But they &apos;re also trying to under@@ mine everything in the game .
And they do it sec@@ ret@@ ly through mis@@ information and ambigu@@ ities and ir@@ relev@@ anci@@ es , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
The s@@ ab@@ ot@@ eur is there , and we also read from Sun T@@ z@@ u &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Art of War . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ th-@@ grad@@ ers understand it — nine years old — and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow — at first they do — the pa@@ ths to power and destruction , the path to war .
They learn to over@@ look shor@@ t-@@ si@@ ghted re@@ actions and impul@@ sive thinking , to think in a long-term , more conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al way .
Ste@@ w@@ art Br@@ and is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a Co@@ E@@ volution Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly article on a peace force .
And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
I &apos;m just a clock wat@@ cher .
I &apos;m just a cl@@ ari@@ fier . I &apos;m just a facil@@ it@@ ator .
The students run the game .
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
( Video ) Boy : The World Peace G@@ ame is serious .
You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
See , Mr. Hun@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has mess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
John Hun@@ ter : I offered them a — ( Applause ) Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
And so I apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze to them as well .
I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sinc@@ ere apo@@ logy , and they take it very seriously .
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
( Video ) JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negoti@@ ations as of now . Go .
( Ch@@ at@@ ter ) JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
I &apos;ve learned to ce@@ de control of the classroom over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedic@@ ation to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them open@@ ly .
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
In this game we had a little girl , and she was the De@@ fen@@ se Min@@ ister of the poorest nation .
And the De@@ fen@@ se Min@@ ister — she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
And she was next door to a very weal@@ thy , o@@ il@@ -@@ rich neighbor .
Without pro@@ voc@@ ation , suddenly she att@@ acked , against her Pri@@ me Min@@ ister &apos;s orders , the n@@ ex@@ t-@@ door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
She mar@@ ched into the oil field reser@@ ves , surrounded it , without fir@@ ing a shot , and sec@@ u@@ red it and held it .
And that neighbor was unable to conduc@@ t any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
We were all upset with her , &quot; &quot; Why are you doing this ?
This is the World Peace G@@ ame . What is wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; To her gir@@ l@@ friends she said that .
That &apos;s a bre@@ ach there .
And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tan@@ ks .
( Laughter ) They are the tou@@ gh@@ est op@@ pon@@ ents .
And we were very upset .
I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
But come to find out , a few game days later — and there are turns where we take negoti@@ ation from a team — actually there &apos;s a negoti@@ ation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negoti@@ ation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offen@@ sive to domin@@ ate the entire world .
H@@ ad they had their fuel suppl@@ ies , they would have done it .
She was able to see the v@@ ectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosoph@@ ical decision to attack in a peace game .
Now she used a small war to aver@@ t a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosoph@@ ical discussion about whether that was right , condi@@ tional good , or not right .
That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
It came about spon@@ taneously through their collective wisdom .
( Applause ) Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
If you &apos;re a military command@@ er and you w@@ age tro@@ ops — the little plastic toys on the board — and you lose them , I put in a letter .
You have to write a letter to their parents — the fic@@ tional parents of your fic@@ tional tro@@ ops — explaining what happened and off@@ ering your con@@ dol@@ ences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to combat .
And so we had this situation come up — last summer actually , at Ag@@ nor@@ -@@ H@@ ur@@ t School in Al@@ b@@ em@@ ar@@ le Coun@@ ty — and one of our military command@@ ers got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; &quot; Mr. Hun@@ ter , let &apos;s ask — there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot; &quot; There was a parent vis@@ iting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
&quot; &quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more re@@ aler if she reads it . &quot; &quot; So we did , we asked her , and she gam@@ ely picked up the letter .
&quot; &quot; S@@ ure . &quot; &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
She read two sentences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
I was in tears .
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the win@@ ners are not glo@@ ating .
We all lose .
And it was an amazing occurr@@ ence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
He &apos;s been in many batt@@ les .
( Video ) David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people att@@ acking .
I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun T@@ z@@ u said one week .
One week he said , &quot; &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been winning batt@@ les , so I &apos;m going into batt@@ les , more batt@@ les .
And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun T@@ z@@ u said .
JH : I get ch@@ ills every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
But it &apos;s self-@@ evid@@ ent ass@@ ess@@ ment .
We know that &apos;s an authenti@@ c ass@@ ess@@ ment of learning .
We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend B@@ ren@@ n@@ an .
We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the inter@@ loc@@ king crises .
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s ass@@ et value has to be increased above its starting point .
Some are poor , some are weal@@ thy . There are billions .
The World Bank president was a thir@@ d-@@ grad@@ er one time .
He says , &quot; &quot; How many zer@@ os in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot; &quot; But he was setting fisc@@ al policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even po@@ orer .
There was no way they could win .
And we were approach@@ ing four o &apos;@@ clock , our cu@@ t-@@ off time — there was about a minute left — and des@@ pair just sett@@ led over the room .
I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
I should have gotten it so they could have won .
They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and de@@ j@@ ected .
And suddenly , B@@ ren@@ n@@ an walked over to my chair and he gr@@ ab@@ bed the b@@ ell , the b@@ ell I ring to signal a change or a re@@ conven@@ ing of cab@@ in@@ ets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the b@@ ell .
Everybody ran to his chair : there was scre@@ aming ; there was y@@ elling , w@@ aving of their dossi@@ ers .
They get these dossi@@ ers full of secret documents .
They were g@@ esti@@ cul@@ ating ; they were running around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
Pr@@ in@@ cip@@ al walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And B@@ ren@@ n@@ an runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
He r@@ ings the b@@ ell again . He says , &quot; &quot; We have &quot; &quot; — and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock — &quot; &quot; we have , all nations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our funds together .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to offer it as a don@@ ation to this poor country .
And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their ass@@ et value and we can win the game .
Will you accept it ? &quot; &quot; And there are three seconds left on the clock .
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And the game is won .
S@@ pon@@ tane@@ ous compassion that could not be plann@@ ed for , that was unexpected and un@@ predictable .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
Some games are more about war@@ fare .
But I don &apos;t try to den@@ y them that reality of being human .
I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloo@@ d@@ less way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
If only .
And on be@@ half of all of my teachers on whose shoul@@ ders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause )
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
He lives in a small village in southern Som@@ alia .
His village is near Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
D@@ rou@@ ght drives the small village into poverty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ vation .
With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , the capital of Som@@ alia .
When he arri@@ ves , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
He ends up living in a tent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
Maybe a year passes , nothing .
One day , he &apos;s approach@@ ed by a gentleman who off@@ ers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
He me@@ ets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
He is introduced to this young woman .
He eventually gets married .
He starts this new life .
He has a purpose in life .
One beautiful day in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , under an az@@ ure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomb@@ er , and that dynamic group of people were al S@@ hab@@ a@@ ab , a terrorist organization linked to al Q@@ a@@ eda .
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing himself up ?
He was waiting .
He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call wai@@ tho@@ od .
And his story repe@@ ats itself in urban centers around the world .
It is the story of the dis@@ en@@ franch@@ ised , un@@ employ@@ ed urban youth who spar@@ ks ri@@ ots in Joh@@ ann@@ es@@ burg , spar@@ ks ri@@ ots in London , who re@@ aches out for something other than wai@@ tho@@ od .
For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosper@@ ity of their cities .
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s youth who suffer from the highest un@@ employment rates .
By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of wai@@ tho@@ od , the g@@ at@@ e@@ way to terrorism , to violence , to gang@@ s , will be the story of cities 2.@@ 0 .
And in my city of birth , Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , 70 percent of young people suffer from un@@ employment .
70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
They pretty much do nothing .
I went back to Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u last month , and I went to visit Mad@@ ina Ho@@ sp@@ ital , the hospital I was born in .
I remember standing in front of that bul@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ dden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
What if I had been forced into that same state of wai@@ tho@@ od ?
Would I have become a terrorist ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepren@@ eur@@ ship sum@@ mit .
I brought together about 90 young Som@@ al@@ i leaders .
We sat down and brain@@ st@@ orm@@ ed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
He went to university in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , gradu@@ ated .
There were no jobs , no opportunities .
I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , un@@ employ@@ ed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al S@@ hab@@ a@@ ab and other terrorist organizations , to be recru@@ ited .
They sou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different route .
In Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , the biggest barri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
Tw@@ enty-@@ three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system , and a motor@@ bike can be the eas@@ iest way to get around .
A@@ den saw an opportunity and se@@ ized it .
He started a motor@@ bike company .
He began r@@ enting out motor@@ bi@@ kes to local res@@ idents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
He bought 10 bi@@ kes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to identify and se@@ ize a new opportunity .
It &apos;s entrepren@@ eur@@ ship , and I believe entrepren@@ eur@@ ship can be the most powerful tool against wai@@ tho@@ od .
It em@@ powers young people to be the cre@@ ators of the very economic opportunities they are so desper@@ ately see@@ king .
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
I want to talk to you about a young man who attend@@ ed one of my meetings , Mo@@ ham@@ ed Mo@@ ham@@ oud , a fl@@ or@@ ist .
He was helping me train some of the young people at the sum@@ mit in entrepren@@ eur@@ ship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepren@@ eur@@ ship .
He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mo@@ ham@@ ed came along , if you wanted flowers at your we@@ dding , you used plastic bou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ pped from ab@@ road .
If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh flowers ? &quot;
for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; &quot; Never . &quot; &quot; So Mo@@ ham@@ ed saw an opportunity .
He started a lands@@ cap@@ ing and design fl@@ oral company .
He created a farm right outside of Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , and started growing tu@@ li@@ ps and l@@ il@@ ies , which he said could survive the har@@ sh Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u climate .
And he began deli@@ vering flowers to we@@ d@@ dings , creating gard@@ ens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
There &apos;s no public park in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ro@@ ses .
And he doesn &apos;t grow ro@@ ses because they use too much water , by the way .
So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mo@@ ham@@ ed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
They had never really thought about starting up a business .
They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ GO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
They came up with entrepreneuri@@ al solutions to local problems .
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepren@@ eur@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
They need expertise and ment@@ or@@ ship to guide them in developing and laun@@ ching their businesses .
Conn@@ ect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ide@@ ation to creation , and you will create cataly@@ sts for urban growth .
For me , entrepren@@ eur@@ ship is more than just starting up a business .
It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
Mo@@ ham@@ ed is not simply selling flowers .
I believe he is selling hope .
His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
A@@ den hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bi@@ kes for him .
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paraly@@ sis of wai@@ tho@@ od .
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and nur@@ ture their inher@@ ent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Par@@ ks than of car bomb@@ s and wai@@ tho@@ od .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. Jam@@ ire Willi@@ ams on the dr@@ ums , ( Applause ) Bur@@ n@@ iss Tr@@ avis on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian S@@ ands on the piano . ( Applause )
So the band@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
It is really a sacred space .
And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the band@@ stand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; Tit@@ i Bo@@ om . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for proj@@ ected ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musici@@ an , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the band@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a pal@@ ette , that soun@@ ded like this ...
( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F@@ . ( Music )
See , these are all right inside of the color pal@@ ette .
If you played an E@@ .
See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional pal@@ ette that we were painting .
If you played an F # though , ( D@@ iss@@ on@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
And we &apos;re going to play on this pal@@ ette .
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this pal@@ ette .
( Music ) So someone could concep@@ tually perceive that as a mistake .
The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So it &apos;s un@@ predictable . We &apos;ll paint this pal@@ ette again .
He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
I ended up creating a mel@@ o@@ dy out of it .
The texture changed in the dr@@ ums this time .
It got a little bit more rhyth@@ mic , a little bit more intense in response to how I respon@@ ded to it .
So there is no mistake .
The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musici@@ an is not aware and accep@@ ting enough of his fellow band member to in@@ corporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
So jazz , this band@@ stand is absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s a very pu@@ ri@@ fying experience .
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
We know that to be able to come on the band@@ stand and play music is a bl@@ essing .
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stere@@ oty@@ pically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t mic@@ roman@@ age in jazz .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
If I come up and I dic@@ t@@ ate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chao@@ tic because I &apos;m bul@@ lying my ideas .
I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
This is a science of listening .
It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of inten@@ sity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it buil@@ ds .
W@@ atch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
( Music ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nu@@ anced .
It &apos;s not about bul@@ lying my vision or anything like that .
It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accep@@ ting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
Thank you .
( Applause )
( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innov@@ ate fundamentally in education .
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re en@@ thr@@ all@@ ed to in education .
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible spe@@ e@@ ches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the aw@@ k@@ ward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
So most everyone wat@@ ches TV .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
The average American wat@@ ches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , ber@@ ate it .
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly refl@@ ects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually dis@@ sem@@ inate our entire value system .
So all these things are uni@@ quel@@ y human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
We &apos;re talking about top@@ -@@ 10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over the course of 50 years .
How do these Ni@@ el@@ s@@ en rat@@ ings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective un@@ conscious , but how do these top@@ -@@ 10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal k@@ ingdom , including humans , have four basic prim@@ al instinc@@ ts .
You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the ur@@ ge for acqu@@ is@@ iti@@ veness .
As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temp@@ er , or ta@@ me , these basic animal instinc@@ ts .
We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
We feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity .
That is separate and apart from the animal k@@ ingdom .
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entert@@ ained .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separ@@ ates us from the animal k@@ ingdom .
An@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uni@@ quel@@ y human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this cartoon dev@@ il or ang@@ el sitting on our shoul@@ ders .
Is television literally func@@ tioning as our conscience , temp@@ ting us and re@@ war@@ ding us at the same time ?
So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
We went back 50 years to the 195@@ 9 / 1960 television season .
We surve@@ yed the top@@ -@@ 20 Ni@@ el@@ s@@ en shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,@@ 600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emo@@ tionally .
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambigu@@ ity ?
Did you feel ou@@ tr@@ age ? Did you laugh ?
What did this mean for you ?
So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
And on a f@@ actual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are ex@@ ported around the world .
So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
Two ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank leg@@ end@@ ary rabb@@ i , Jack S@@ tern .
And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community super@@ star Hans Ros@@ ling , who you may have just seen .
Okay , here we go .
So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambigu@@ ity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that u@@ pli@@ ft me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
M@@ oral ambigu@@ ity are telev@@ isions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding stea@@ dy .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
M@@ oral ambigu@@ ity starts to climb .
Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambigu@@ ity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wan@@ e .
Why ?
The C@@ ub@@ an M@@ issi@@ le C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is shot , the Ci@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts movement , race ri@@ ots , the Vietnam War , M@@ L@@ K is shot , B@@ ob@@ by Kennedy is shot , W@@ ater@@ gate .
Look what happens .
In 1970 , inspiration pl@@ um@@ mets .
M@@ oral ambigu@@ ity takes off .
They cross , but R@@ on@@ ald Re@@ agan , a tele@@ gen@@ ic president , is in office .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran@@ -@@ Con@@ tra , the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er disaster , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l .
M@@ oral ambigu@@ ity becomes the dominant mem@@ e in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
Take a look at this .
This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social comment@@ ary and ir@@ rever@@ ence in blue and green .
Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bon@@ anz@@ a , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
This is rising . Com@@ fort st@@ ays whole .
Ir@@ rever@@ ence starts to rise .
Social comment@@ ary is all of a sudden spi@@ king up .
You get to 196@@ 9 , and look what happens .
You have comfort , ir@@ rever@@ ence , and social comment@@ ary , not only batt@@ ling it out in our society , but you literally have two establ@@ ishment shows — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er P@@ y@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 196@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ three-@@ r@@ ated television shows .
What &apos;s number one ?
The soci@@ ally ir@@ rever@@ ent hi@@ pp@@ ie show , &quot; R@@ ow@@ an and Martin &apos;s L@@ augh@@ -@@ In . &quot;
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Vi@@ e@@ wers had respon@@ ded dramatically .
Look at this green spi@@ ke in 196@@ 6 to a b@@ ell@@ we@@ ther show .
When you guys hear this industry term , a break@@ out hit , what does that mean ?
It means in the 196@@ 6 television season , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mothers Bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
This was the first show that allowed vie@@ wers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the pres@@ id@@ ency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a break@@ out show .
So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
In 1970 , the dam bur@@ sts . The dam bur@@ sts .
Com@@ fort is no longer why we watch television .
Social comment@@ ary and ir@@ rever@@ ence rise throughout the 70s .
Now look at this .
The 70s means who ? Nor@@ man L@@ ear .
You have &quot; &quot; All in the F@@ am@@ ily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ ford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 70s — &quot; M@@ AS * H@@ . &quot;
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ran@@ ked most highly for ir@@ rever@@ ence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top@@ -@@ 10 during the Ni@@ xon administration .
Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
So to this very , very sav@@ v@@ y crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disrup@@ tive .
Arch@@ ie B@@ un@@ ker was sho@@ ved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribu@@ te : fantas@@ y and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s m@@ apped against the red dot , un@@ employment , which is a simple Bu@@ reau of L@@ ab@@ or Department stati@@ stic .
You &apos;ll see that every time fantas@@ y and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spi@@ ke in un@@ employment .
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being un@@ employ@@ ed ?
No . In the 70s you have the b@@ ell@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ onic Woman &quot; &quot; that rock@@ eted into the top@@ -@@ 10 in 197@@ 3 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six M@@ illi@@ on-@@ D@@ oll@@ ar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Charlie &apos;s An@@ g@@ els . &quot; &quot; Another spi@@ ke in the 1980s — another spi@@ ke in shows about control and power .
What were those shows ?
G@@ lam@@ or@@ ous and rich .
&quot; D@@ all@@ as , &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ y Island . &quot;
In@@ cre@@ dible m@@ apping of our national psy@@ che with some hard and fast facts : un@@ employment .
So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-@@ camera sit@@ com and the rise of reality TV .
Well , as we say in the business , X mar@@ ks the spot .
The 90s — the big bubbles of hu@@ mor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Fri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ as@@ ier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Che@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ eld . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low un@@ employment .
But look : X mar@@ ks the spot .
In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , hu@@ mor succ@@ um@@ bs to jud@@ gment once and for all .
Why not ?
We had a 2000 pres@@ identi@@ al election decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me Cour@@ t .
We had the bur@@ sting of the tech bubble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x becomes part of the social lex@@ icon .
Look what happens when we keep going .
At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
What do people want in their TV then ?
I would have thought reven@@ ge or no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
No , they want jud@@ gment .
I can vote you off the island .
I can keep Sarah Pal@@ in &apos;s daughter dancing .
I can choose the next American I@@ do@@ l . You &apos;re fi@@ red .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
We &apos;re animals , we need our mom@@ s .
There has not been a decade of television without a defin@@ itive , dominant TV mom .
The 195@@ 0s : June C@@ le@@ ever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ ave it to Be@@ av@@ er . &quot; &quot; Luc@@ ille B@@ all kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
Mau@@ de F@@ ind@@ lay , the ep@@ it@@ ome of the ir@@ rever@@ ent 197@@ 0s , who tack@@ led abor@@ tion , divor@@ ce , even men@@ op@@ ause on TV .
The 1980s , our first cou@@ gar was given to us in the form of Alex@@ is C@@ arr@@ ington .
Mur@@ ph@@ y Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single par@@ en@@ tho@@ od .
This era &apos;s mom , B@@ ree V@@ an de K@@ am@@ p .
Now I don &apos;t know if this is the dev@@ il or the ang@@ el sitting on our conscience , sitting on television &apos;s shoul@@ ders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
So to you all , the women of TED@@ Women , the men of TED@@ Women , the global audiences of TED@@ Women , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
But let me also thank the incredible cre@@ ators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television scre@@ ens throughout all these ages of television .
They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ wers , through your collective social consci@@ ences , that give it life , long@@ ev@@ ity , power or not .
So thanks very much .

Well we all know the World W@@ ide Web has absolutely transformed publ@@ ishing , broad@@ cas@@ ting , commerce and social connec@@ tivity , but where did it all come from ?
And I &apos;ll quote three people : V@@ ann@@ ev@@ ar Bush , Dou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art and Tim Ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ Lee .
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
This is V@@ ann@@ ev@@ ar Bush .
V@@ ann@@ ev@@ ar Bush was the U.S. government &apos;s chief scientific advis@@ er during the war .
And in 19@@ 45 , he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Mon@@ th@@ ly .
And the article was called &quot; &quot; As We May Think . &quot; &quot; And what V@@ ann@@ ev@@ ar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken .
We don &apos;t work in terms of libr@@ aries and cat@@ alo@@ g systems and so forth .
The brain works by association .
With one it@@ em in its thought , it sn@@ aps inst@@ antly to the next it@@ em .
And the way information is struc@@ tured is totally in@@ capable of keeping up with this process .
And so he suggested a machine , and he called it the mem@@ e@@ x .
And the mem@@ e@@ x would link information , one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .
Now this was in 19@@ 45 .
A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
And nobody knew anything about it .
So this was before the computer was invented .
And he pro@@ posed this machine called the mem@@ e@@ x .
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
So sp@@ inning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Dou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art , and he was a U.S. Air Force offic@@ er .
And he was reading it in their library in the F@@ ar East .
And he was so inspired by this article , it kind of direc@@ ted the rest of his life .
And by the mid-@@ 60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California .
He built a system .
The system was designed to aug@@ ment human intelligence , it was called .
And in a pre@@ mon@@ ition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softw@@ ares of service , his system was called N@@ L@@ S for o@@ N@@ -@@ L@@ ine Sy@@ stem .
And this is Dou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art .
He was giving a presentation at the F@@ all Jo@@ int Com@@ pu@@ ter Con@@ ference in 196@@ 8 .
What he showed — he sat on a stage like this , and he demonstr@@ ated this system .
He had his head mic like I &apos;ve got .
And he works this system .
And you can see , he &apos;s working between documents and graphics and so forth .
And he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-@@ finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he spec@@ ially designed in order to do this system .
So this is where the mouse came from as well .
So this is Dou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art .
The trouble with Dou@@ g En@@ gel@@ b@@ art &apos;s system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds .
So for a personal computer , a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane ; it wasn &apos;t really very practical .
But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
And my company , O@@ W@@ L built a system called Gu@@ ide for the Apple Mac@@ in@@ to@@ sh .
And we delivered the world &apos;s first hyper@@ text system .
And this began to get a head of stea@@ m .
Apple introduced a thing called Hy@@ per@@ C@@ ard , and they made a bit of a fus@@ s about it .
They had a 12@@ -@@ page suppl@@ ement in the Wall Street Journ@@ al the day it launched .
The magazines started to cover it .
B@@ y@@ te magazine and Commun@@ ications at the A@@ C@@ M had special issues covering hyper@@ text .
We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Mac@@ in@@ to@@ sh version .
And our PC version became quite mature .
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
You were able to deliver documents , were able to do it over networks .
We developed a system such that it had a mark@@ up language based on h@@ t@@ m@@ l .
We called it h@@ m@@ l : hyper@@ text mark@@ up language .
And the system was capable of doing very , very large document@@ ation systems over computer networks .
So I took this system to a trade show in Ver@@ s@@ ailles near Paris in late No@@ vember 1990 .
And I was approach@@ ed by a nice young man called Tim Ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ Lee who said , &quot; &quot; Are you I@@ an R@@ itch@@ ie ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I need to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he told me about his pro@@ posed system called the World W@@ ide Web .
And I thought , well , that &apos;s got a pre@@ tenti@@ ous name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
But he was completely convinced that his World W@@ ide Web would take over the world one day .
And he tried to persu@@ ade me to write the brow@@ ser for it , because his system didn &apos;t have any graphics or fon@@ ts or lay@@ out or anything ; it was just plain text .
I thought , well , you know , interesting , but a guy from CE@@ R@@ N , he &apos;s not going to do this .
So we didn &apos;t do it .
In the next couple of years , the hyper@@ text community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
In 199@@ 2 , his paper was rej@@ ected for the Hy@@ per@@ text Con@@ ference .
In 1993 , there was a table at the conference in Seattle , and a guy called Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en was demonstr@@ ating his little brow@@ ser for the World W@@ ide Web .
And I saw it , and I thought , y@@ ep , that &apos;s it .
And the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , and I had no opposition in having Tim Ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ Lee as the key@@ note speaker .
So that puts me in pretty ill@@ us@@ tri@@ ous company .
There was a guy called D@@ ick Ro@@ we who was at Dec@@ ca Rec@@ or@@ ds and turned down The Beat@@ les .
There was a guy called G@@ ary K@@ il@@ d@@ all who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see Bill Gates .
And the 12 publ@@ ish@@ ers who turned down J@@ .@@ K. R@@ ow@@ ling &apos;s Harry P@@ ot@@ ter , I guess .
On the other hand , there &apos;s Mar@@ c An@@ dre@@ ess@@ en who wrote the world &apos;s first brow@@ ser for the World W@@ ide Web .
And according to For@@ tune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
But is he happy ?

In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambo@@ dia , and I met a 12@@ -year-old boy who had been tor@@ tured and was den@@ ied access to coun@@ sel .
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political pris@@ on@@ ers , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12@@ -year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
He was not a political pris@@ oner .
He was a 12@@ -year-old boy who had st@@ ol@@ en a bicycle .
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambo@@ dia , but of the 1@@ 13 developing countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tor@@ tured .
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool .
We often think of tor@@ ture as being political tor@@ ture or reser@@ ved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for political pris@@ on@@ ers .
It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en-@@ down legal systems , and unfortunately because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of investi@@ gation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to coun@@ sel — it is what happens most of the time .
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
First is the training , empower@@ ment , and connection of def@@ end@@ ers worldwide .
The second is insur@@ ing that there is system@@ atic early access to coun@@ sel .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
Could we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I founded International Bri@@ dges to Jus@@ tice which has a specific mission of ending tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool and implement@@ ing due process rights in the 9@@ 3 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in cour@@ tro@@ oms .
My first experiences , though , did come from Cambo@@ dia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambo@@ dia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 att@@ or@@ neys in the country because the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge had killed them all .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so conse@@ qu@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12@@ -year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
The first group of def@@ end@@ ers came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investi@@ gation ? &quot;
And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; Kh@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ ended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investi@@ gation , because they all come with conf@@ essions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the conf@@ essions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
And it took a lot of courage for these def@@ end@@ ers to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implement@@ ing these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the jud@@ ges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a veget@@ able sel@@ ler , she was sitting outside of a house .
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks st@@ ole whatever the je@@ wel@@ ry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
She was pregnant at the time . She had cigar@@ ette bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mis@@ carried .
And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your tor@@ ture conf@@ ession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the def@@ end@@ ers began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambo@@ dia .
But Cambo@@ dia is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cambo@@ dia ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
In Bur@@ un@@ di I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12@@ -year-old boy , it was an 8@@ -year-old boy for ste@@ aling a mobile phone .
Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was acc@@ used of ste@@ aling two di@@ apers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to cour@@ age@@ ously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
For example , in Cambo@@ dia , it was that &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people m@@ um@@ bling
and gr@@ um@@ bling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 6@@ 8 lawyers who have been system@@ atically taking the cases .
The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were tor@@ tur@@ ing everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tors and jud@@ ges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to def@@ end@@ ers .
And they showed me a manu@@ al which actually was an excellent manu@@ al .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ yers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
Pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tors were perfectly trained .
But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tured . &quot;
So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to system@@ atically implement early access to coun@@ sel , because they are the sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tured .
And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Zimbab@@ we , but def@@ end@@ ers all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
We have a program called Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , and we realized there are people that are cour@@ age@@ ous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
So it &apos;s an online cont@@ est where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implement@@ ing justice .
And there are 30 Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers throughout the world , from S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka to Sw@@ az@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through par@@ al@@ eg@@ al programs , through whatever they can do .
And it &apos;s not only these Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ M@@ ak@@ ers , but people we cour@@ age@@ ously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot tor@@ ture people or they will be pun@@ ished .
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very cour@@ age@@ ous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implement@@ ed ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on Dec@@ ember 4 , he organized three thousand members of the You@@ th Commun@@ ist Le@@ ague , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed pos@@ ters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-@@ violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support def@@ end@@ ers .
We need to system@@ atically implement early access to coun@@ sel .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wil@@ dly ide@@ alistic .
Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id .
It began with a small group of people who decided they would comm@@ it .
Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite po@@ ems from the def@@ end@@ ers , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the st@@ akes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only def@@ end@@ ers , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end tor@@ ture as an investig@@ ative tool .
I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of V@@ ish@@ na , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bri@@ dges to Jus@@ tice .
V@@ ish@@ na was a 4@@ -year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambo@@ di@@ an prison in K@@ and@@ al Pro@@ v@@ ince . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the gu@@ ards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that V@@ ish@@ na was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pin@@ k@@ ie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 15@@ 6 pris@@ on@@ ers . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corru@@ g@@ ated , and he would put his fingers through .
And most of the pris@@ on@@ ers said that he was their greatest joy and their sun@@ shine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s V@@ ish@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -year-old boy .
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own her@@ o@@ ic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probab@@ ly I can &apos;t do everything .
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the proph@@ e@@ tic imagination to imagine the shap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
And yet you accept the meeting inv@@ itation , and you go .
And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
And a well-@@ run meeting can yi@@ eld really positive , acti@@ on@@ able results .
And everybody leaves very angry .
It &apos;s kind of funny .
( Video ) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important propos@@ al .
Hi , it &apos;s Joe . I &apos;m working from home today .
( Laughter ) Hi , Joe . Thanks for jo@@ ining us today , great .
Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important propos@@ al .
Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
A couple of weeks after I put that online , 5@@ 00,000 people in dozens of countries , I mean dozens of countries , watched this video .
And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of views every month .
&quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
&quot; This is my life . &quot;
One guy wrote , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s funny because it &apos;s true .
It made me laugh until I cri@@ ed .
And cri@@ ed . And I cri@@ ed some more . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This poor guy said , &quot; My daily life until reti@@ rement or death , sig@@ h . &quot;
A common theme running through all of these comm@@ ents online is this fundamental belief that we are power@@ less to do anything other than go to meetings and suffer through these poor@@ ly run meetings and live to meet another day .
But the truth is , we &apos;re not power@@ less at all .
It &apos;s right at our finger@@ tips , literally .
It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No M@@ AS !
It &apos;s okay , you &apos;re allowed , that &apos;s why it &apos;s there .
It &apos;s right next to the accept button .
Or the maybe button , or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately .
And you can make more thou@@ ght@@ ful decisions about accep@@ ting it .
People might actually start sending out agend@@ as . Imagine !
People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
Let me show you what I mean .
There are billions of inter@@ connected neurons in an impossible t@@ angle .
But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
Sir K@@ en Rob@@ in@@ son — creativity is key to our kids &apos; future .
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful force shap@@ ing human culture .
Two , give your listen@@ ers a reason to care .
Cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
And I need you to be honest with the answer .
Can I ask you to please rec@@ all a time when you really loved something — a movie , an album , a song or a book — and you recomm@@ ended it wh@@ ol@@ e@@ hear@@ te@@ dly to someone you also really liked , and you anticip@@ ated that reaction , you wai@@ ted for it , and it came back , and the person h@@ ated it ?
So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years . ( Laughter ) I teach high school math .
I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
So there &apos;s a useful stere@@ oty@@ pe about students that I see , a useful stere@@ oty@@ pe about you all .
I could give you guys an al@@ ge@@ br@@ a-@@ two final ex@@ am , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
For example , fac@@ tor@@ ing quad@@ r@@ atic@@ s with leading co@@ effici@@ ents greater than one .
This stuff is also really easy to re@@ learn , provided you have a really strong gr@@ ounding in reas@@ oning . M@@ ath reas@@ oning — we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us — this is hard to teach .
This is what we would love students to ret@@ ain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but en@@ sures they won &apos;t ret@@ ain it .
So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a cal@@ am@@ ity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reas@@ oning wrong in your classroom .
One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-@@ start .
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-@@ explain the entire thing at their des@@ ks .
Stu@@ dents lack pers@@ ever@@ ance .
They lack re@@ tention ; you find yourself re-@@ explaining concepts three months later , wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale .
There &apos;s an aver@@ sion to word problems , which descri@@ bes 99 percent of my students .
And then the other one percent is e@@ ag@@ er@@ ly looking for the form@@ ula to apply in that situation .
This is really destruc@@ tive .
David Mil@@ ch , cre@@ ator of &quot; &quot; D@@ ea@@ d@@ wood &quot; &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
He sw@@ ore off creating contemporary dr@@ ama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; &quot; Two and a Hal@@ f M@@ en , &quot; &quot; no dis@@ respect , it shapes the neural path@@ ways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
He called it , &quot; &quot; an im@@ patience with ir@@ resolution . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re im@@ patient with things that don &apos;t resol@@ ve quickly .
You expect sit@@ com@@ -@@ si@@ zed problems that w@@ rap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to reti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our text@@ books — particularly mass@@ -@@ adopted text@@ books — teach math reas@@ oning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s func@@ tionally equivalent to turning on &quot; &quot; Two and a Hal@@ f M@@ en &quot; &quot; and calling it a day .
( Laughter ) In all seri@@ ousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics text@@ book .
It appl@@ ies equally to math .
No@@ tice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a form@@ ula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compu@@ te .
I believe in real life .
And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a sur@@ plus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have suffici@@ ent information and had to go find some .
I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
And the text@@ book , I think , knows how it &apos;s ham@@ str@@ inging students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just sw@@ apping out numbers and tw@@ ea@@ king the context a little bit .
And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stam@@ p this was mol@@ ded from , it help@@ fully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the form@@ ula .
You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to dec@@ ode a text@@ book . That &apos;s a shame .
So I can diagno@@ se the problem a little more specifically in math .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defin@@ ing ste@@ ep@@ ness and s@@ lo@@ pe using a ski lift .
But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re com@@ pressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this im@@ patient problem solving .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
You also have the mathematical structure , talking about gri@@ ds , measu@@ rements , lab@@ els , points , ax@@ es , that sort of thing .
You have sub@@ steps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the ste@@ ep@@ est .
So I hope you can see .
I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re p@@ aving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ating our students for how well they can step over the small cr@@ acks in the way .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the ste@@ ep@@ est ?
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can def@@ end two answers .
So you get people argu@@ ing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journ@@ aling , whatever .
And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting an@@ no@@ ying to talk about the ski@@ er in the lower left-@@ hand side of the screen or the ski@@ er just above the mi@@ d line .
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D lab@@ els to talk about them more easily .
And then as we start to define what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measu@@ rements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
The math ser@@ ves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole s@@ lo@@ pe , ste@@ ep@@ ness thing .
But if you need to , your students can then develop those sub@@ steps together .
Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that — which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reas@@ oning ?
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And I &apos;ll yi@@ eld the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
He talked about the form@@ ulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t invol@@ ve them in the form@@ ulation of the problem .
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of pre@@ p time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my text@@ book and rebuild them in a way that sup@@ ports math reas@@ oning and patient problem solving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
First things first , we elim@@ inate all the sub@@ steps .
Stu@@ dents have to develop those , they have to form@@ ulate those .
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
None of it &apos;s a distr@@ actor , so we lose that .
Stu@@ dents need to decide , &quot; &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
Does the color of the val@@ ve matter ? What matters here ? &quot; &quot; S@@ uch an under@@ represented question in math curr@@ icul@@ um .
So now we have a water tank .
How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in text@@ books , we go out and we take a picture of it .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agon@@ iz@@ ingly slowly .
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
Stu@@ dents are looking at their wat@@ ches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve b@@ ai@@ ted the ho@@ ok , right ?
And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intr@@ o , I teach kids — because of my in@@ experience — I teach the kids that are the most re@@ medi@@ al , all right ?
And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the form@@ ula ; someone else knows how to work the form@@ ula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answer@@ ing the question , &quot; &quot; How long will it take ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematic@@ ally and convers@@ ation@@ ally inti@@ mid@@ ated jo@@ ining the conversation .
We put names on the board , att@@ ach them to gu@@ esses , and kids have bought in here .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s e@@ dition .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theore@@ tical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s e@@ dition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theore@@ tical does not match up with the practical .
But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-@@ install@@ ed with these viruses day one of the class .
These are the kids who now , one sem@@ ester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
We &apos;re no longer aver@@ se to word problems , because we &apos;ve re@@ defined what a word problem is .
We &apos;re no longer inti@@ mid@@ ated by math , because we &apos;re slowly re@@ defin@@ ing what math is .
This has been a lot of fun .
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multi@@ media , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shor@@ test question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the text@@ book is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reas@@ oning , to be less helpful .
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-@@ quality curr@@ icul@@ um in our front pocket .
It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribu@@ te it fre@@ ely under open licen@@ ses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; &quot; which , w@@ ow .
I put this problem on my blog recently : In a gro@@ cer@@ y store , which line do you get into , the one that has one car@@ t and 19 it@@ ems or the line with four car@@ ts and three , five , two and one it@@ ems .
And the linear mod@@ eling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; &quot; Good Mor@@ ning America &quot; &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
M@@ ath makes sense of the world .
M@@ ath is the vocab@@ ul@@ ary for your own intuition .
So I just really encourage you , whatever your st@@ ake is in education — whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever — ins@@ ist on better math curr@@ icul@@ um .
We need more patient problem sol@@ vers . Thank you . ( Applause )
Inter@@ pre@@ ter : Pi@@ ano , &quot; &quot; p , &quot; &quot; is my favorite musical symbol .
It means to play sof@@ tly .
If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; &quot; p &quot; &quot; in the score , you need to play sof@@ ter .
Two p &apos;s — even sof@@ ter .
Four p &apos;s — extremely soft .
This is my drawing of a p-@@ tree , which demonstr@@ ates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never reach complete silence .
That &apos;s my current definition of silence : a very obs@@ cure sound .
I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American S@@ ign L@@ angu@@ age , A@@ S@@ L , plus a bit of my own background .
So it has a history of about 200 years .
I was born dea@@ f , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
And I believed it to be true .
Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
S@@ ound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day .
As a D@@ ea@@ f person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a foreign country , blind@@ ly following its rules , cu@@ st@@ oms , behaviors and nor@@ ms without ever ques@@ tioning them .
So how is it that I understand sound ?
Well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .
You people are like my lou@@ d@@ speakers , and am@@ pli@@ fy sound .
I learn and mirror that behavior .
At the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respond to me .
Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ...
&quot; Don &apos;t sl@@ am the door ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t make too much noise when you &apos;re eating from the po@@ tat@@ o-@@ chip bag ! &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t bur@@ p , and when you &apos;re eating , make sure you don &apos;t scr@@ ape your u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils on the plate . &quot; &quot; All of these things I term &quot; &quot; sound e@@ ti@@ quette . &quot; &quot; Maybe I think about sound e@@ ti@@ quette more than the average hearing person does .
I &apos;m hyper@@ -@@ vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant around sound .
And I &apos;m always waiting in e@@ ager nervous anticip@@ ation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next .
H@@ ence , this drawing .
T@@ B@@ D , to be decided .
T@@ BC , to be continued .
T@@ B@@ A , to be announced .
And you notice the staff — there are no notes cont@@ ained in the lines .
That &apos;s because the lines already contain sound through the subtle s@@ mu@@ dges and sm@@ ears .
In D@@ ea@@ f culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
This is a sign for &quot; &quot; staff &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
A typical staff contains five lines .
Yet for me , sig@@ ning it with my thum@@ b stic@@ king up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural .
That &apos;s why you &apos;ll notice in my drawings , I stick to four lines on paper .
In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artist res@@ id@@ ency there .
Pri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pain@@ ter .
During this summer , I visited different mus@@ eu@@ ms and gall@@ ery spaces , and as I went from one place to the next , I noticed there was no visual art there .
At that time , sound was tr@@ ending , and this struck me ...
there was no visual art , everything was audit@@ ory .
Now sound has come into my art territ@@ ory .
Is it going to further distance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experienced through the ears .
It could be felt t@@ actually , or experienced as a visual , or even as an idea .
So I decided to re@@ claim ow@@ nership of sound and to put it into my art practice .
And everything that I had been taught regar@@ ding sound , I decided to do away with and un@@ learn .
I started creating a new body of work .
And when I presented this to the art community , I was blo@@ wn away with the amount of support and attention I received .
I realized : sound is like money , power , control — social curr@@ ency .
In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person &apos;s thing .
And sound is so powerful that it could either dis@@ em@@ power me and my art@@ work , or it could em@@ power me .
I chose to be empowered .
There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language .
And just because I don &apos;t use my liter@@ al voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .
So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice .
And that way , I &apos;m able to maintain relev@@ ancy in society today .
So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different A@@ S@@ L interpre@@ ters .
And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me to be heard .
And their voices hold value and curr@@ ency .
I@@ ron@@ ically , by bor@@ ro@@ wing out their voices , I &apos;m able to maintain a tempor@@ ary form of curr@@ ency , kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate .
If I didn &apos;t continue this practice , I feel that I could just fa@@ de off into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on and not maintain any form of social curr@@ ency .
So with sound as my new art medium , I del@@ ved into the world of music .
And I was surprised to see the simil@@ ari@@ ties between music and A@@ S@@ L .
For example , a musical note cannot be fully captured and ex@@ pressed on paper .
And the same holds true for a concept in A@@ S@@ L .
They &apos;re both highly spatial and highly infl@@ ected — meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds .
I &apos;d like to share with you a piano metaphor , to have you have a better understanding of how A@@ S@@ L works .
So , en@@ vision a piano .
A@@ S@@ L is broken down into many different gram@@ mati@@ cal param@@ eters .
If you as@@ sign a different param@@ eter to each finger as you play the piano — such as facial expression , body movement , speed , hand shape and so on , as you play the piano — English is a linear language , as if one key is being pressed at a time .
However , A@@ S@@ L is more like a ch@@ ord — all 10 fingers need to come down simul@@ taneously to express a clear concept or idea in A@@ S@@ L .
If just one of those keys were to change the ch@@ ord , it would create a completely different meaning .
The same appl@@ ies to music in regar@@ ds to pitch , tone and volume .
In A@@ S@@ L , by playing around with these different gram@@ mati@@ cal param@@ eters , you can express different ideas .
For example , take the sign T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
This is the sign T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
I &apos;m looking at you .
Star@@ ing at you .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Oh — bu@@ sted . ( Laughter )
U@@ h-@@ oh .
What are you looking at ?
A@@ w , stop .
( Laughter ) I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at A@@ S@@ L through a musical lens ? &quot;
If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
For example , this is the sign for &quot; &quot; day , &quot; &quot; as the sun ris@@ es and sets .
This is &quot; &quot; all day . &quot; &quot; If I was to repeat it and slow it down , visu@@ ally it looks like a piece of music .
All ... day .
I feel the same holds true for &quot; &quot; all night . &quot; &quot; &quot; All night . &quot;
This is AL@@ L@@ -@@ NI@@ G@@ H@@ T , represented in this drawing .
And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; over@@ night , &quot; ( S@@ ings ) &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I feel like the third one has a lot more mus@@ ic@@ ality than the other two . ( Laughter )
This represents how time is ex@@ pressed in A@@ S@@ L and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time .
For example , 1@@ H is one hand , 2@@ H is two hand , present ten@@ se happens closest and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back .
So , the first example is &quot; &quot; a long time ago . &quot; &quot; Then &quot; &quot; past , &quot; &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favorite , with the very roman@@ tic and dramatic notion to it , &quot; once upon a time . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; Com@@ mon time &quot; is a musical term with a specific time signature of four be@@ ats per measure .
Yet when I see the word &quot; &quot; common time , &quot; &quot; what automatically comes to mind for me is &quot; &quot; at the same time . &quot; &quot; So notice R@@ H : right hand , L@@ H : left hand .
We have the staff across the head and the chest .
&#91; H@@ ead : R@@ H , Fl@@ ash cl@@ aw &#93; &#91; Com@@ mon time &#93; &#91; Ch@@ est : L@@ H , Fl@@ ash cl@@ aw &#93; I &apos;m now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the &quot; &quot; flash cl@@ aw . &quot; &quot; Can you please follow along with me ?
Everybody , hands up .
Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the chest , kind of like &quot; &quot; common time &quot; &quot; or at the same time .
Yes , got it .
That means &quot; &quot; to fall in love &quot; &quot; in International &#91; S@@ ign &#93; .
( Laughter ) International &#91; S@@ ign &#93; , as a note , is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world .
The second one I &apos;d like to demonstrate is this — please follow along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; &quot; colon@@ ization &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
( Laughter ) Now the third — please follow along again .
And again .
This is &quot; &quot; en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment &quot; &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; colon@@ ization &quot; and &quot; &quot; en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; Good job , everyone .
So it &apos;s amazing to see how A@@ S@@ L is alive and thri@@ ving , just like music is .
However , in this day and age , we live in a very audi@@ o-@@ cen@@ tric world .
And just because A@@ S@@ L has no sound to it , it automatically holds no social curr@@ ency .
We need to start thinking harder about what defin@@ es social curr@@ ency and allow A@@ S@@ L to develop its own form of curr@@ ency — without sound .
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclu@@ sive society .
And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be dea@@ f to learn A@@ S@@ L , nor do you have to be hearing to learn music .
A@@ S@@ L is such a rich tre@@ a@@ sure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
And I &apos;d like to invite you to open your ears , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visual language .
And you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
( Applause ) Thank you .
Den@@ ise K@@ ah@@ l@@ er-@@ Bra@@ aten : Hey , that &apos;s me .
( Applause )
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
It &apos;s produced by the Qu@@ ad@@ ro Cor@@ por@@ ation of West Virgin@@ ia .
It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a R@@ adi@@ o Sh@@ ack anten@@ na attached to it .
So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
It &apos;s like , are science and pl@@ um@@ bing compati@@ ble ?
And if it looks a lot like a Bu@@ ick hu@@ b@@ cap , it &apos;s because it is .
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ cap ready to go .
In the case of Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
Here &apos;s the Vir@@ gin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sa@@ o Pau@@ lo .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
Here &apos;s the Vir@@ gin Mary on the back@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off .
I was born and raised in North Korea .
Al@@ though my family constantly struggl@@ ed against poverty , I was always loved and car@@ ed for first , because I was the only son and the youn@@ g@@ est of two in the family .
But then the great famine began in 1994 .
I was four years old .
My sister and I would go searching for fire@@ wood starting at 5 in the morning and come back after mid@@ night .
I would w@@ ander the streets searching for food , and I remember seeing a small child tied to a mother &apos;s back eating chips , and wanting to steal them from him .
Hun@@ ger is hum@@ iliation . Hun@@ ger is hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
For a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
On my nin@@ th birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
But even as a child , I could feel the heav@@ iness in their hearts .
Over a million North Kore@@ ans died of star@@ vation in that time , and in 2003 , when I was 13 years old , my father became one of them .
I saw my father wi@@ ther away and die .
In the same year , my mother disappeared one day , and then my sister told me that she was going to China to earn money , but that she would return with money and food soon .
Since we had never been separated , and I thought we would be together forever , I didn &apos;t even give her a hu@@ g when she left .
It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life .
But again , I didn &apos;t know it was going to be a long good@@ bye .
I have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
Su@@ dd@@ enly , I became an orph@@ an and hom@@ eless .
My daily life became very hard , but very simple .
My goal was to find a du@@ sty piece of bread in the tr@@ ash .
But that is no way to survive .
I started to realize , be@@ gging would not be the solution .
So I started to steal from food car@@ ts in illegal markets .
Sometimes , I found small jobs in exchange for food .
Once , I even spent two months in the winter working in a coal mine , 33 meters underground without any protection for up to 16 hours a day .
I was not un@@ common .
Many other orph@@ ans survived this way , or worse .
When I could not fall as@@ le@@ ep from bit@@ ter cold or hunger p@@ ains , I hop@@ ed that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
That hope kept me alive .
I don &apos;t mean big , grand hope .
I mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tr@@ ash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
But if I didn &apos;t believe it , I wouldn &apos;t even try , and then I would die .
H@@ ope kept me alive .
Every day , I told myself , no matter how hard things got , still I must live .
After three years of waiting for my sister &apos;s return , I decided to go to China to look for her myself .
I realized I couldn &apos;t survive much longer this way .
I knew the journey would be ris@@ ky , but I would be ris@@ king my life either way .
I could die of star@@ vation like my father in North Korea , or at least I could try for a better life by es@@ cap@@ ing to China .
I had learned that many people tried to cross the border to China in the night@@ time to avoid being seen .
North Kore@@ an border gu@@ ards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission .
Chinese soldiers will catch and send back North Kore@@ ans , where they face severe pun@@ ishment .
I decided to cross during the day , first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because I knew I was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , I thought I might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
I made it to China on February 15 , 2006 .
I was 16 years old .
I thought things in China would be easier , since there was more food .
I thought more people would help me .
But it was harder than living in North Korea , because I was not free .
I was always worried about being caught and sent back .
By a miracle , some months later , I met someone who was running an underground shelter for North Kore@@ ans , and was allowed to live there and eat regular me@@ als for the first time in many years .
L@@ ater that year , an activis@@ t helped me escape China and go to the United States as a refugee .
I went to America without knowing a word of English , yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school .
Even in North Korea , I was an F student .
( Laughter ) And I barely finished el@@ ement@@ ary school .
And I remember I fought in school more than once a day .
T@@ ext@@ books and the library were not my play@@ ground .
My father tried very hard to motiv@@ ate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
At one point , my father gave up on me .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not my son anymore . &quot; &quot; I was only 11 or 12 , but it hurt me deeply .
But n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
So in America , it was kind of ridiculous that they said I should go to high school .
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
I decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
But one day , I came home and my fo@@ ster mother had made chicken wings for dinner .
And during dinner , I wanted to have one more wing , but I realized there were not enough for everyone , so I decided against it .
When I looked down at my plate , I saw the last chicken wing , that my fo@@ ster father had given me his .
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
He just looked back at me very warm@@ ly , but said no words .
Su@@ dd@@ enly I remembered my biological father .
My fo@@ ster father &apos;s small act of love reminded me of my father , who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry , even if he was star@@ ving .
I felt so suff@@ oc@@ ated that I had so much food in America , yet my father died of star@@ vation .
My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him , and that night I also thought of what else I could do to honor him .
And my answer was to promise to myself that I would study hard and get the best education in America to honor his sacrifice .
I took school seriously , and for the first time ever in my life , I received an academic aw@@ ard for excell@@ ence , and made de@@ an &apos;s list from the first sem@@ ester in high school .
( Applause ) That chicken wing changed my life .
( Laughter ) H@@ ope is personal . H@@ ope is something that no one can give to you .
You have to choose to believe in hope .
You have to make it yourself .
In North Korea , I made it myself .
H@@ ope brought me to America .
But in America , I didn &apos;t know what to do , because I had this overwhel@@ ming freedom .
My fo@@ ster father at that dinner gave me a direction , and he motiv@@ ated me and gave me a purpose to live in America .
I did not come here by myself .
I had hope , but hope by itself is not enough .
Many people helped me along the way to get here .
North Kore@@ ans are fighting hard to survive .
They have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
This is my message to you .
Have hope for yourself , but also help each other .
Life can be hard for everyone , wherever you live .
My fo@@ ster father didn &apos;t inten@@ d to change my life .
In the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the small@@ est act of love .
A piece of bread can satis@@ fy your hunger , and having the hope will bring you bread to keep you alive .
But I confi@@ d@@ ently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another Joseph &apos;s life and change thousands of other Jo@@ se@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survive .
Thank you .
( Applause ) A@@ dri@@ an Hong : Joseph , thank you for sharing that very personal and special story with us .
I know you haven &apos;t seen your sister for , you said , it was almost exactly a decade , and in the off chance that she may be able to see this , we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message .
Joseph K@@ im : In Kore@@ an ?
A@@ H : You can do English , then Kore@@ an as well .
( Laughter ) J@@ K : Okay , I &apos;m not going to make it any longer in Kore@@ an because I don &apos;t think I can make it without t@@ earing up .
N@@ un@@ a , it has been already 10 years that I haven ’ t seen you .
I just wanted to say that I miss you , and I love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
And I — oh , go@@ sh .
I still haven &apos;t given up my hope to see you .
I will live my life happ@@ ily and study hard until I see you , and I promise I will not cry again .
( Laughter ) Yes , I &apos;m just looking forward to seeing you , and if you can &apos;t find me , I will also look for you , and I hope to see you one day .
And can I also make a small message to my mom ?
A@@ H : S@@ ure , please .
J@@ K : I haven &apos;t spent much time with you , but I know that you still love me , and you probably still pr@@ ay for me and think about me .
I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a dist@@ or@@ ted sequence of characters like this ?
How many of you found it really , really an@@ no@@ ying ?
Okay , out@@ standing . So I invented that .
( Laughter ) Or I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the enti@@ ty filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to sub@@ mit the form millions and millions of times .
The reason it works is because humans , at least non-@@ visu@@ all@@ y-@@ imp@@ ai@@ red humans , have no trouble reading these dist@@ or@@ ted squ@@ ig@@ gly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
So for example , in the case of T@@ ick@@ et@@ master , the reason you have to type these dist@@ or@@ ted characters is to prevent sc@@ al@@ pers from writing a program that can buy millions of tic@@ kets , two at a time .
C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As are used all over the Internet .
And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
So this is an example from the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o reg@@ istr@@ ation page .
The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , sp@@ ell a word .
But the best part is the message that the Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o help desk got about 20 minutes later .
T@@ ext : &quot; &quot; Hel@@ p ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This person thought they needed to wait .
This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
( Laughter ) C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A Project is something that we did here at Car@@ ne@@ gie M@@ ell@@ l@@ on over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
This is a project that we call re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , which is something that we started here at Car@@ ne@@ gie M@@ ell@@ on , then we turned it into a star@@ tu@@ p company .
And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acqui@@ red this company .
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the following realiz@@ ation : It turns out that approxim@@ ately 200 million C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As are ty@@ ped everyday by people around the world .
When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
But then I started feeling bad .
See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
And if you multi@@ ply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is was@@ ting about 5@@ 00,000 hours every day ty@@ ping these an@@ no@@ ying C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As .
So then I started feeling bad .
( Laughter ) And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
So see , here &apos;s the thing .
While you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
Another way of putting it is , is there some hu@@ mon@@ g@@ ous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10@@ -@@ second ch@@ un@@ ks such that each time somebody sol@@ ves a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A they solve a little bit of this problem ?
And the answer to that is &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
So what you may not know is that now@@ ad@@ ays while you &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , not only are you authenti@@ c@@ ating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
So let me explain how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
Google has one . The Internet Ar@@ chi@@ ve has one .
Amazon , now with the K@@ ind@@ le , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
( Laughter ) So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
Now scann@@ ing a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
It gives you an image for every page of the book .
This is an image with text for every page of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to dec@@ i@@ ph@@ er all of the words in this image .
That &apos;s using a technology called O@@ CR , for op@@ tical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
Now the problem is that O@@ CR is not perfect .
E@@ spec@@ ially for older books where the ink has f@@ aded and the pages have turned yellow , O@@ CR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re ty@@ ping a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A on the Internet .
So the next time you type a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A , these words that you &apos;re ty@@ ping are actually words that are coming from books that are being di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed that the computer could not recognize .
And now the reason we have two words now@@ ad@@ ays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assu@@ mes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you ty@@ ped the other word correc@@ tly .
And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed accur@@ ately .
So this is how the system works .
And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of web@@ sites have started swit@@ ching from the old C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people was@@ ted their time to the new C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A where people are helping to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
So for example , T@@ ick@@ et@@ master .
So every time you buy tic@@ kets on T@@ ick@@ et@@ master , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book .
Facebook : Every time you add a friend or po@@ ke somebody , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book .
Twitter and about 3@@ 50,000 other sites are all using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
And in fact , the number of sites that are using re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing per day is really , really large .
It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people ty@@ ping C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ As on the Internet .
( Applause ) Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two random@@ ly chosen English words next to each other .
So funny things can happen .
For example , we presented this word .
It &apos;s the word &quot; &quot; Christi@@ ans &quot; &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
But if you present it along with another random@@ ly chosen word , bad things can happen .
So we get this . ( T@@ ext : bad ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ ans ) But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Em@@ bass@@ y of the K@@ ingdom of God .
( Laughter ) O@@ ops . ( Laughter )
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
John@@ Ed@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ .com ( T@@ ext : D@@ am@@ n liberal ) ( Laughter ) So we keep on insul@@ ting people left and right everyday .
Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insul@@ ting people .
See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re pres@@ enting two random@@ ly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet mem@@ e that tens of thousands of people have particip@@ ated in , which is called C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A art .
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A that you think is somewhat pec@@ uli@@ ar , like this C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A . ( T@@ ext : invisible to@@ aster ) Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
Then of course , you fill out the C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book .
But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s how it works .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Some of them are very cute . ( T@@ ext : cl@@ en@@ ched it ) ( Laughter ) Some of them are fun@@ ni@@ er .
( T@@ ext : st@@ oned f@@ oun@@ ders ) ( Laughter ) And some of them , like pal@@ e@@ onto@@ logical sh@@ vis@@ le , they contain S@@ no@@ op Do@@ g@@ g . ( Laughter )
Okay , so this is my favorite number of re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A .
So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
This is the number of distinct people that have helped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze at least one word out of a book through re@@ C@@ A@@ P@@ T@@ C@@ H@@ A : 7@@ 50 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge .
And it is numbers like these that motiv@@ ate my research agenda .
So the question that motiv@@ ates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s lar@@ ge-@@ scale achiev@@ ements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done histor@@ ically — like for example , building the pyram@@ ids of Egypt or the Pan@@ ama Can@@ al or putting a man on the Moon — there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordin@@ ating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 7@@ 50 million people to help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze human knowledge .
So the question that motiv@@ ates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-@@ qui@@ et@@ ly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , sh@@ hh@@ h@@ h !
( Laughter ) Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
It started with me pos@@ ing a question to my graduate student , S@@ ever@@ in H@@ ack@@ er .
Okay , that &apos;s S@@ ever@@ in H@@ ack@@ er .
So I posed the question to my graduate student .
By the way , you did hear me correc@@ tly ; his last name is H@@ ack@@ er .
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people transl@@ ating the Web into every major language for free ?
Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
First of all , transl@@ ating the Web .
So right now the Web is parti@@ tioned into multiple languages .
A large fraction of it is in English .
If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
But there &apos;s large fr@@ actions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
Why can &apos;t we use machine trans@@ lation ?
Mach@@ ine trans@@ lation now@@ ad@@ ays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mistakes .
Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
Actually it was a for@@ um post .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
It was translated from Japanese into English .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person starts apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
So the next sentence is is going to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to the question .
So he &apos;s just explaining something .
Remember , it &apos;s a question about J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ cri@@ pt .
( T@@ ext : At often , the go@@ at-@@ time inst@@ all a error is v@@ om@@ it . ) ( Laughter ) Then comes the first part of the question .
( T@@ ext : How many times like the wind , a pole , and the drag@@ on ? ) ( Laughter ) Then comes my favorite part of the question .
( T@@ ext : This insul@@ t to father &apos;s stones ? ) ( Laughter ) And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
( T@@ ext : Please apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze for your stupi@@ d@@ ity . There are a many thank you . ) ( Laughter ) Okay , so computer trans@@ lation , not yet good enough .
So back to the question .
So we need people to translate the whole Web .
So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
We could pay professional language transl@@ ators to translate the whole Web .
We could do that .
Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
For example , transl@@ ating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars — and this is at even the most explo@@ ited , out@@ sourc@@ ing country out there .
So it would be very expensive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people transl@@ ating the Web into every major language for free .
Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hur@@ d@@ les , two big obstacles .
The first one is a lack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als .
So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us translate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
How are we going to motiv@@ ate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
Nor@@ m@@ ally , you have to pay people to do this .
So how are we going to motiv@@ ate them to do it for free ?
Now when we were starting to think about this , we were bloc@@ ked by these two things .
But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
And that is to transform language trans@@ lation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bil@@ in@@ gu@@ als , and that is language education .
So it turns out that today , there are over 1.@@ 2 billion people learning a foreign language .
People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
So people really , really want to learn a new language .
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website — it &apos;s called Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go — where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simul@@ taneously transl@@ ating the Web .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beg@@ inner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
People really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
So people really do learn a language .
And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
Because you see with Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , people are actually learning with real content .
As opposed to learning with ma@@ de-@@ up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inher@@ ently interesting .
So people really do learn a language .
But perhaps more surprisingly , the transl@@ ations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beg@@ in@@ ners , the transl@@ ations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language transl@@ ators , which is very surprising .
So let me show you one example .
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
The top is the German .
The middle is an English trans@@ lation that was done by somebody who was a professional English transl@@ ator who we paid 20 cents a word for this trans@@ lation .
And the bottom is a trans@@ lation by users of Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
Now of course , we play a trick here to make the transl@@ ations as good as professional language transl@@ ators .
We combine the transl@@ ations of multiple beg@@ in@@ ners to get the quality of a single professional transl@@ ator .
Now even though we &apos;re combin@@ ing the transl@@ ations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
Remember , this is 50 million doll@@ ar@@ s-@@ worth of value .
So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hop@@ eful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Ros@@ et@@ ta St@@ one 500 dollars .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the current business model .
The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extremely un@@ fair towards the poor .
This is totally bi@@ ased towards the rich .
Now see , in Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re transl@@ ating stuff — which for example , we could charge somebody for transl@@ ations .
So this is how we could mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze this .
Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language .
So the nice thing about Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is I think it provides a fair business model — one that doesn &apos;t discrimin@@ ate against poor people .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
( Applause ) So here &apos;s the site .
We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private bet@@ a , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
We haven &apos;t yet launched this Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go .
By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
So thank you .

In Oxford in the 195@@ 0s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named A@@ lice Ste@@ w@@ art .
And A@@ lice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 195@@ 0s .
And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youn@@ g@@ est F@@ el@@ low to be elected to the Roy@@ al College of P@@ hys@@ icians .
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divor@@ c@@ ed and was a single parent , she continued her medical work .
And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidem@@ i@@ ology , the study of patterns in disease .
But like every scientist , she appreci@@ ated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it .
The hard problem that A@@ lice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
Most disease is cor@@ related with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from aff@@ lu@@ ent families .
So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anom@@ al@@ y ?
Now , A@@ lice had trouble getting funding for her research .
In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the L@@ ady T@@ ata M@@ em@@ orial prize .
And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
Now , she had no idea what to look for .
This really was a needle in a h@@ ay@@ st@@ ack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of .
H@@ ad the children eaten bo@@ iled swe@@ ets ?
H@@ ad they consum@@ ed colo@@ red dr@@ in@@ ks ?
Did they eat fish and chips ?
Did they have in@@ door or out@@ door pl@@ um@@ bing ?
What time of life had they started school ?
And when her carbon cop@@ ied ques@@ tionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statis@@ tical cl@@ arity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X-@@ ray@@ ed when pregnant .
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom .
Con@@ venti@@ onal wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a th@@ res@@ hold .
It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusias@@ m for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X-ray machine .
And it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
N@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , A@@ lice Ste@@ w@@ art r@@ ushed to publ@@ ish her pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary fin@@ dings in The L@@ anc@@ et in 195@@ 6 .
People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and A@@ lice really was in a big hur@@ ry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared .
In fact , she need not have hur@@ ried .
It was fully 25 years before the British and medical — British and American medical establ@@ ish@@ ments aband@@ oned the practice of X-@@ r@@ aying pregnant women .
The data was out there , it was open , it was fre@@ ely available , but nobody wanted to know .
A child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
O@@ pen@@ ness alone can &apos;t drive change .
So for 25 years A@@ lice Ste@@ w@@ art had a very big fight on her hands .
So , how did she know that she was right ?
Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
She worked with a stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an named George K@@ n@@ ea@@ le , and George was pretty much everything that A@@ lice wasn &apos;t .
So , A@@ lice was very out@@ going and soci@@ able , and George was a rec@@ lu@@ se .
A@@ lice was very warm , very emp@@ a@@ thetic with her patients .
George frankly pre@@ fer@@ red numbers to people .
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
He said , &quot; &quot; My job is to prove Dr. Ste@@ w@@ art wrong . &quot; &quot; He activ@@ ely sou@@ ght dis@@ confir@@ mation .
Di@@ ff@@ er@@ ent ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of cr@@ un@@ ching the data in order to dis@@ prove her .
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories .
Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give A@@ lice the confidence she needed to know that she was right .
It &apos;s a fantastic model of collaboration — thinking partners who aren &apos;t ech@@ o cham@@ bers .
I wonder how many of us have , or d@@ are to have , such collabor@@ ators .
A@@ lice and George were very good at conflict .
They saw it as thinking .
So what does that kind of construc@@ tive conflict require ?
Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves .
That means we have to res@@ ist the neuro@@ biological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different back@@ gr@@ ounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy .
And the more I &apos;ve thought about this , the more I think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
Because you simply won &apos;t comm@@ it that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds .
A@@ lice &apos;s daughter told me that every time A@@ lice went hea@@ d-@@ to-@@ head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again .
&quot; &quot; My mother , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-@@ to-@@ one relationship .
But it stri@@ kes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest dis@@ as@@ ters that we &apos;ve experienced , mostly haven &apos;t come from individuals , they &apos;ve come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of aff@@ ecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives .
So how do organizations think ?
Well , for the most part , they don &apos;t .
And that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
And they can &apos;t because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict .
In surve@@ ys of European and American exec@@ uti@@ ves , fully 85 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issues or concer@@ ns at work that they were afraid to raise .
Af@@ raid of the conflict that that would provo@@ ke , afraid to get em@@ bro@@ iled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
E@@ igh@@ ty-@@ five percent is a really big number .
It means that organizations mostly can &apos;t do what George and A@@ lice so tri@@ um@@ ph@@ antly did .
They can &apos;t think together .
And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them .
So how do we develop the skills that we need ?
Because it does take skill and practice , too .
If we aren &apos;t going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it .
So , recently , I worked with an execu@@ tive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company .
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on .
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created mar@@ g@@ ins of error that could really hurt people .
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
So , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
After all , maybe they knew something he didn &apos;t .
Maybe he &apos;d look stupid .
But he kept wor@@ rying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved .
In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concer@@ ns .
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation .
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doub@@ ts .
So now Joe had al@@ lies . They could think together .
And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device .
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whist@@ le-@@ blo@@ wer , except that like almost all whist@@ le-@@ b@@ lowers , he wasn &apos;t a cr@@ ank at all , he was pas@@ sion@@ ately dev@@ oted to the organization and the higher pur@@ poses that that organization served .
But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
And when he dar@@ ed to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
And his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a cr@@ ank .
They think of him as a leader .
So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ?
Well , the University of Del@@ ft requires that its Ph@@ D students have to sub@@ mit five stat@@ ements that they &apos;re prepared to def@@ end .
It doesn &apos;t really matter what the stat@@ ements are about , what matters is that the candi@@ dates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
I think it &apos;s a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to Ph@@ D candi@@ dates is far too few people , and way too late in life .
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society .
The fact is that most of the biggest catastr@@ oph@@ es that we &apos;ve witn@@ essed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden .
It comes from information that is fre@@ ely available and out there , but that we are w@@ ill@@ fully blind to , because we can &apos;t handle , don &apos;t want to handle , the conflict that it provo@@ kes .
But when we d@@ are to break that silence , or when we d@@ are to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking .
O@@ pen information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
But the truth won &apos;t set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it .
O@@ pen@@ ness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .

Thank you .
Two years ago , I stood on the TED stage in Ar@@ ush@@ a , Tanzan@@ ia .
I spoke very briefly about one of my prou@@ dest cre@@ ations .
It was a simple machine that changed my life .
Before that time , I had never been away from my home in Mal@@ aw@@ i .
I had never used a computer .
I had never seen an Internet .
On the stage that day , I was so nervous .
My English lost , I wanted to v@@ om@@ it .
( Laughter ) I had never been surrounded by so many az@@ un@@ g@@ u , white people . ( Laughter )
There was a story I wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
I would like to share that story today .
We have seven children in my family .
All sisters , excep@@ ting me .
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy .
Before I discovered the won@@ ders of science , I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers .
Like everyone else , we grew mai@@ ze .
One year our fortune turned very bad .
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine .
Within five months all Mal@@ a@@ wi@@ ans began to star@@ ve to death .
My family ate one meal per day , at night .
Only three s@@ wal@@ lows of n@@ sim@@ a for each one of us .
The food passes through our bodies .
We drop down to nothing .
In Mal@@ aw@@ i , the second@@ ary school , you have to pay school fe@@ es .
Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
It was the future I couldn &apos;t accept .
I felt very happy to be at the second@@ ary school , so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
So I went to a library .
I read books , science books , especially physics .
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
I used diagr@@ ams and pictures to learn the words around them .
Another book put that knowledge in my hands .
It said a wind@@ mil@@ l could pump water and generate electricity .
P@@ ump water meant irri@@ gation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
So I decided I would build one wind@@ mil@@ l for myself .
But I didn &apos;t have materials to use , so I went to a scr@@ ap yard where I found my materials .
Many people , including my mother , said I was crazy .
( Laughter ) I found a tr@@ actor fan , shock absor@@ ber , P@@ V@@ C pi@@ pes .
U@@ sing a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynam@@ o , I built my machine .
It was one light at first .
And then four lights , with swit@@ ches , and even a circuit break@@ er , mod@@ eled after an electric b@@ ell .
Another machine pum@@ ps water for irri@@ gation .
Qu@@ eues of people start lin@@ ing up at my house ( Laughter ) to charge their mobile phone .
( Applause ) I could not get rid of them .
( Laughter ) And the re@@ porters came too , which lead to blo@@ gg@@ ers and which lead to a call from something called TED .
I had never seen an airplane before .
I had never sle@@ pt in a hotel .
So , on stage that day in Ar@@ ush@@ a , my English lost , I said something like , &quot; I tried . And I made it . &quot;
So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
God bl@@ ess .
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet .
I say to you , trust yourself and believe .
Wh@@ at@@ ever happens , don &apos;t give up .
Thank you .

In the 1980s in the commun@@ ist Eastern Germany , if you owned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to reg@@ ister it with the government .
You had to reg@@ ister a sample sheet of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restric@@ t freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufactu@@ rer and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a fus@@ s about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers .
We have three main groups .
We have online criminals .
Like here , we have Mr. D@@ im@@ i@@ try Gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ e@@ v in U@@ kr@@ aine .
And the mo@@ tives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ aires online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ aires , who made money with their attacks .
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir T@@ s@@ ast@@ s@@ in form T@@ ar@@ tu in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez .
This is Stephen Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n Sun@@ d@@ in .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w Anderson , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on .
These guys make their for@@ tu@@ nes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to steal money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
The U.S. Sec@@ re@@ t Ser@@ vice , two months ago , fro@@ ze the S@@ wis@@ s bank account of Mr. Sam J@@ ain right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. J@@ ain himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
They &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else — motiv@@ ated by prot@@ ests , motiv@@ ated by an opinion , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ ony@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
So those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : criminals who do it for the money , hack@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts like An@@ ony@@ mous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a Cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ ority from The Ne@@ ther@@ lands — or actually , it was .
It was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were h@@ acked into .
Some@@ body broke in and they h@@ acked it thor@@ ough@@ ly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with D@@ ut@@ ch government represent@@ atives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ sible that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .A.
They sell certi@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with certi@@ fic@@ ates ?
Well you need a certi@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cryp@@ ted services , services like G@@ mail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like Iran , where dissi@@ dents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ worthy than the local services and they are en@@ cryp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discussions .
Ex@@ cept they can if they h@@ ack into a foreign C@@ .A.
and issue ro@@ gue certi@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
What about Arab Spr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
Well in Egypt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ oted the head@@ quarters of the Egypti@@ an secret police in A@@ pr@@ il 2011 , and when they were lo@@ oting the building they found lots of papers .
A@@ mon@@ g those papers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ tled &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ IS@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egypti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s to the Egypti@@ an government .
The company head@@ quarters are right here .
So Western governments are providing tot@@ al@@ itarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by German government offici@@ als to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be t@@ apped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will tap your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like State Tro@@ j@@ an to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is impl@@ ied .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we blind@@ ly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
We ret@@ ain just 25 percent of what we hear .
It &apos;s about enjo@@ ying mun@@ d@@ ane sounds .
This , for example , is my tum@@ ble dr@@ yer .
Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .

I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality — questions of good and evil and right and wrong — are questions about which science offici@@ ally has no opinion .
It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
And , conse@@ qu@@ ently , most people — I think most people probably here — think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
&quot; What constitu@@ tes a good life ? &quot;
So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion — that the separ@@ ation between science and human values is an illusion — and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science de@@ als with facts , and facts and values seem to bel@@ ong to different sp@@ her@@ es .
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite clearly un@@ true .
Val@@ ues are a certain kind of fact .
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical oblig@@ ations toward rocks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a f@@ actual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have mis@@ constru@@ ed the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point re@@ du@@ cible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death — either to an et@@ ern@@ ity of happiness with God or an et@@ ern@@ ity of suffering in hell — you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
And to say that such changes can pers@@ ist after death is itself a f@@ actual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continu@@ um of such facts .
We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are mur@@ dered in@@ discrimin@@ ately .
And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continu@@ um towards something quite a bit more id@@ yl@@ lic , to a place where a conference like this is even conce@@ iv@@ able .
And we know — we know — that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
Would adding chol@@ era to the water be a good idea ?
Probab@@ ly not .
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probab@@ ly not .
There are tru@@ ths to be known about how human communities fl@@ our@@ ish , whether or not we understand these tru@@ ths .
And morality rel@@ ates to these tru@@ ths .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels — from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrang@@ ements .
But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necess@@ ity , talking about the human brain .
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain — whatever happens after death .
Even if the suicide bomb@@ er does get 72 vir@@ g@@ ins in the after@@ life , in this life , his personality — his rather un@@ fortunate personality — is the product of his brain .
So the contribu@@ tions of culture — if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings fl@@ our@@ ish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a mat@@ ur@@ ing science of the mind — neuroscience , psychology , etc .
So , what I &apos;m argu@@ ing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts — to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
And we can therefore visu@@ alize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with pea@@ ks and val@@ le@@ ys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
And these aw@@ ait our discovery .
Perhaps some of these states can be appropri@@ ately called my@@ s@@ tical or spiritual .
Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are struc@@ tured but other minds possibly could access them .
Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaran@@ te@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conce@@ iv@@ able moral question .
I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consul@@ t a super@@ computer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can de@@ duc@@ t the full cost of TED as a business ex@@ pense .
( Laughter ) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
And just ad@@ m@@ itting this — just ad@@ m@@ itting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans fl@@ our@@ ish — will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corpor@@ al pun@@ ishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a woo@@ den board , hard , and raising large bru@@ ises and bl@@ is@@ ters and even breaking the skin .
And hundreds of thousands of children , in@@ cident@@ ally , are subj@@ ected to this every year .
The loc@@ ations of these en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed distric@@ ts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
We &apos;re not talking about Conn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut .
And the r@@ ationale for this behavior is explic@@ it@@ ly religious .
The cre@@ ator of the universe himself has told us not to sp@@ are the ro@@ d , l@@ est we spo@@ il the child — this is in Pro@@ ver@@ bs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public hum@@ iliation as a way of encour@@ aging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
( Laughter ) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly un@@ defined , and seem@@ ingly perpe@@ tually open to be re-@@ constru@@ ed .
And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
Well , consider by analo@@ gy , the concept of physical health .
The concept of physical health is un@@ defined .
As we just heard from Michael Sp@@ ecter , it has changed over the years .
When this statue was car@@ ved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we me@@ dd@@ le with our gen@@ omes in such a way that not being able to run a mar@@ ath@@ on at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
People will send you don@@ ations when you &apos;re in that condition .
( Laughter ) No@@ tice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genu@@ in@@ ely open for re@@ vision , does not make it vacu@@ ous .
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al as any we make in science .
Another thing to notice is there may be many pea@@ ks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thri@@ ve ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maxim@@ ize human fl@@ our@@ ishing .
Now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ mine an objective morality ?
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be temp@@ ted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
There is clearly a range of materials that constitu@@ te healthy food .
But there &apos;s n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless a clear distinction between food and poison .
The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; &quot; What is food ? &quot; &quot; does not temp@@ t us to say that there are no tru@@ ths to be known about human nutrition .
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral pre@@ cep@@ ts that admit of no exceptions .
So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
Why would we think this ?
Consi@@ der , by analo@@ gy , the game of ch@@ ess .
Now , if you &apos;re going to play good ch@@ ess , a principle like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; &quot; is very good to follow .
But it clearly ad@@ m@@ its some exceptions .
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
And yet , ch@@ ess is a domain of perfect objec@@ tivity .
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are ap@@ t to make in the moral sphere .
Consi@@ der the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &quot; &quot; in Boston or Pal@@ o Al@@ to , who are we to say that the proud den@@ iz@@ ens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wi@@ ves and daughters to live in cl@@ oth bags ?
And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with l@@ eng@@ ths of steel cable , or throw battery ac@@ id in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smo@@ ther@@ ed in this way ?
Well , who are we not to say this ?
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-@@ jud@@ g@@ mental about a practice like this ?
I &apos;m not talking about volun@@ t@@ ary wearing of a ve@@ il — women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
But what does volun@@ t@@ ary mean in a community where , when a girl gets rap@@ ed , her father &apos;s first impul@@ se , rather often , is to mur@@ der her out of shame ?
Just let that fact det@@ on@@ ate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets rap@@ ed , and what you want to do is kill her .
What are the chances that represents a peak of human fl@@ our@@ ishing ?
Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a new@@ s@@ stand almost anywhere in the civil@@ ized world .
Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
( Laughter ) But if we are in a refl@@ ective mo@@ od , we can ask , &quot; &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot; &quot; I mean , is this the opti@@ mal environment in which to raise our children ?
Probab@@ ly not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extre@@ mes that represents a place of better balance .
( Applause ) Perhaps there are many such places — again , given other changes in human culture there may be many pea@@ ks on the moral landscape .
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
Now the ir@@ ony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious dem@@ ago@@ gues of one form or another .
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
In fact , the endur@@ ance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or poverty or any other hu@@ g@@ ely conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al issue .
But the dem@@ ago@@ gues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
Now , what stands in the way of this ?
Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality — especially sec@@ ular , academic , scientist types .
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
So , for instance the Dal@@ ai Lama gets up every morning me@@ dit@@ ating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integr@@ al component of human happiness .
On the other hand , we have someone like T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy ; T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy was very fond of ab@@ duc@@ ting and rap@@ ing and tor@@ tur@@ ing and killing young women .
So , we appear to have a genu@@ ine difference of opinion about how to prof@@ it@@ ably use one &apos;s time .
( Laughter ) Most Western intellectu@@ als look at this situation and say , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dal@@ ai Lama to be really right about — really right about — or for T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy to be really wrong about that ad@@ m@@ its of a real argument that potentially falls within the pur@@ view of science .
He likes chocolate , he likes van@@ illa .
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persu@@ ade the other . &quot; &quot; No@@ tice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have Ed@@ ward W@@ it@@ ten .
He &apos;s a string the@@ or@@ ist .
If you ask the smar@@ test physic@@ ists around who is the smar@@ test physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed W@@ it@@ ten .
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
( Laughter ) So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; &quot; Str@@ ing theory is bo@@ g@@ us .
It doesn &apos;t reson@@ ate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
I &apos;m not a fan . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
I &apos;m the T@@ ed B@@ un@@ dy of string theory .
( Laughter ) I wouldn &apos;t want to bel@@ ong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
Wh@@ enever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be exclu@@ ded .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? How have we convinced ourselves
that every opinion has to count ? How have we convinced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth consi@@ dering ?
Does the Tali@@ ban have a point of view on physics that is worth consi@@ dering ? No .
( Laughter ) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
( Applause ) So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human fl@@ our@@ ishing , and morality rel@@ ates to that domain of facts .
It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and des@@ ires that reli@@ ably lead to nee@@ d@@ less human suffering .
Just ad@@ m@@ itting this will transform our dis@@ course about morality .
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
We live in a world filled with destruc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ invented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
It seems to me , therefore , pat@@ ently obvious that we can no more respect and toler@@ ate vast differences in no@@ tions of human well-being than we can respect or toler@@ ate vast differences in the no@@ tions about how disease sp@@ reads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
We simply must conver@@ ge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , some combus@@ tible material there .
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the scre@@ am@@ ing-@@ with@@ -@@ rage thing , after as well , some of them .
L@@ angu@@ age seems to be really important here .
When you &apos;re talking about the ve@@ il , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cl@@ oth bags .
I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; &quot; No , you know , this is a celebr@@ ation of female speci@@ al@@ ness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; &quot; — and this is argu@@ ably a sophisticated psychological view — &quot; that male l@@ ust is not to be tru@@ sted . &quot;
I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seem@@ ing kind of cultural im@@ peri@@ alist ?
Sam H@@ arr@@ is : Yeah , well I think I tried to bro@@ ach this in a sentence , watching the clock tic@@ king , but the question is : What is volun@@ t@@ ary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaran@@ te@@ ed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?
And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a ve@@ il , or a very funny h@@ at , or tat@@ too their face — I think we should be free to volun@@ tar@@ ily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constr@@ aints that these women are placed under .
And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so e@@ ager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full bur@@ q@@ a .
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
But can you re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that ?
I think I understood you to say that you could re@@ con@@ ci@@ le that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
P@@ aint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , bal@@ ancing moral progress with rich@@ ness .
S@@ H : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it — whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and in@@ so@@ far as we begin to shine light on that we are inev@@ it@@ ably going to conver@@ ge on that fact space .
So , everything is not going to be up for gr@@ abs .
It &apos;s not going to be like ve@@ iling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-@@ educated in the context of men who do desire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an N@@ S@@ F gr@@ ant to know that comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y ve@@ iling is a bad idea — but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interro@@ gate them .
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinc@@ tive current jud@@ gment on some of these issues ?
S@@ H : Well yeah , mod@@ ul@@ o one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly del@@ u@@ sional belief system .
So , you can say like , &quot; &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boy@@ friend , I ch@@ op@@ ped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot; &quot; If you get all those parts align@@ ed , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ec@@ st@@ as@@ y and then blo@@ wing himself up on a bus .
CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
S@@ H : Really an honor . Thank you .

( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . It &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
A few weeks ago , I saw a video on YouTube of Congr@@ ess@@ woman Gab@@ ri@@ elle Gi@@ ff@@ or@@ ds at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bul@@ lets .
This one entered her left h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere , and kno@@ cked out her Bro@@ ca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
And in this session , Gabby &apos;s working with a speech therap@@ ist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more dev@@ ast@@ ated , until she ultimately breaks down into so@@ b@@ bing tears , and she starts so@@ b@@ bing wor@@ d@@ lessly into the arms of her therap@@ ist .
And after a few moments , her therap@@ ist tries a new t@@ ack , and they start singing together , and Gabby starts to sing through her tears , and you can hear her clearly able to en@@ un@@ ci@@ ate the words to a song that describe the way she feels , and she s@@ ings , in one desc@@ ending scale , she s@@ ings , &quot; Let it shine , let it shine , let it shine . &quot;
And it &apos;s a very powerful and poign@@ ant remin@@ der of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail , in this case literally speak .
Se@@ eing this video of Gabby Gi@@ ff@@ or@@ ds reminded me of the work of Dr. G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed Sch@@ lau@@ g , one of the pre@@ em@@ in@@ ent neuro@@ scientists studying music and the brain at Harvard , and Sch@@ lau@@ g is a pro@@ pon@@ ent of a therapy called Mel@@ o@@ di@@ c In@@ ton@@ ation Th@@ er@@ ap@@ y , which has become very popular in music therapy now .
Sch@@ lau@@ g found that his stroke victims who were ap@@ has@@ ic , could not form sentences of thre@@ e@@ - or four-@@ word sentences , but they could still sing the ly@@ r@@ ics to a song , whether it was &quot; &quot; H@@ app@@ y Bir@@ th@@ day To You &quot; &quot; or their favorite song by the E@@ ag@@ les or the R@@ oll@@ ing St@@ ones .
And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons , he found that the music was able to literally re@@ wire the brains of his patients and create a hom@@ olog@@ ous speech center in their right h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere to com@@ pens@@ ate for the left h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere &apos;s damage .
When I was 17 , I visited Dr. Sch@@ lau@@ g &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain — how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-@@ musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our pre@@ frontal cortex all the way back to our cer@@ e@@ bel@@ lu@@ m , how music was becoming a neuro@@ psychiatri@@ c mod@@ ality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ian patients would find that their tre@@ mor and their g@@ ait would stea@@ dy when they listened to music ,
and how lat@@ e-@@ stage Alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dem@@ enti@@ a was so far progr@@ essed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by Ch@@ op@@ in at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
But I had an ul@@ ter@@ ior mo@@ tive of vis@@ iting G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed Sch@@ lau@@ g , and it was this : that I was at a cross@@ roads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
I had just complet@@ ed my under@@ graduate , and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of D@@ enn@@ is Sel@@ ko@@ e , studying Parkinson &apos;s disease at Harvard , and I had fall@@ en in love with neuroscience . I wanted to become a surgeon .
I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Far@@ mer or R@@ ick Ho@@ des , these kind of fear@@ less men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multi@@ dru@@ g@@ -@@ resistant tubercu@@ lo@@ sis , or with children with dis@@ figuring cancers .
I wanted to become that kind of Red Cro@@ ss doctor , that doctor without borders .
On the other hand , I had played the viol@@ in my entire life .
Music for me was more than a passion . It was obsession .
It was oxygen . I was lucky enough to have studied at the Ju@@ illi@@ ard School in Manhattan , and to have played my de@@ but with Z@@ ub@@ in Me@@ h@@ ta and the Israel@@ i phil@@ harmon@@ ic orches@@ tra in T@@ el A@@ vi@@ v , and it turned out that G@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed Sch@@ lau@@ g had studied as an organ@@ ist at the Vi@@ enn@@ a Con@@ serv@@ atory , but had given up his love for music to pursu@@ e a career in medicine . And that afternoon , I had to ask him , &quot; How was it for you making that decision ? &quot;
And he said that there were still times when he w@@ ished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the viol@@ in simply would not .
And after two more years of studying music , I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the M@@ C@@ A@@ T and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. G@@ up@@ ta . ( Laughter ) And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audi@@ tion for the es@@ te@@ em@@ ed Los Angeles Phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
It was my first audi@@ tion , and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week , I was offered the position .
And it was a dream . It was a wild dream to perform in an orches@@ tra , to perform in the ic@@ onic Wal@@ t Disney Con@@ cer@@ t Hall in an orches@@ tra conduc@@ ted now by the famous Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el , but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family , my new musical home .
But a year later , I met another musici@@ an who had also studied at Ju@@ illi@@ ard , one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musici@@ an .
N@@ ath@@ aniel A@@ yers was a double bass@@ ist at Ju@@ illi@@ ard , but he suffered a series of psycho@@ tic ep@@ is@@ odes in his early 20@@ s , was treated with thor@@ az@@ ine at B@@ ell@@ ev@@ ue , and ended up living hom@@ eless on the streets of S@@ kid R@@ ow in down@@ town Los Angeles 30 years later .
N@@ ath@@ aniel &apos;s story has become a be@@ ac@@ on for hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and mental health advoc@@ acy throughout the United States , as told through the book and the movie &quot; &quot; The S@@ olo@@ ist , &quot; &quot; but I became his friend , and I became his viol@@ in teacher , and I told him that wherever he had his viol@@ in , and wherever I had mine , I would play a lesson with him .
And on the many times I saw N@@ ath@@ aniel on S@@ kid R@@ ow , I witn@@ essed how music was able to bring him back from his very dark@@ est moments , from what seemed to me in my un@@ trained eye to be the beg@@ in@@ nings of a schizoph@@ ren@@ ic ep@@ isode .
Pl@@ aying for N@@ ath@@ aniel , the music took on a deeper meaning , because now it was about communication , a communication where words failed , a communication of a message that went deeper than words , that regis@@ tered at a fundamentally prim@@ al level in N@@ ath@@ aniel &apos;s psy@@ che , yet came as a true musical off@@ ering from me .
I found myself growing ou@@ tr@@ aged that someone like N@@ ath@@ aniel could have ever been hom@@ eless on S@@ kid R@@ ow because of his mental illness , yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on S@@ kid R@@ ow alone who had stories as tragic as his , but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets ?
And at the very core of this crisis of mine , I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me , where somehow , perhaps possibly in a very n@@ ai@@ ve sense , I felt what S@@ kid R@@ ow really needed was somebody like Paul Far@@ mer and not another class@@ ical musici@@ an playing on B@@ un@@ ker H@@ ill .
But in the end , it was N@@ ath@@ aniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change , if I wanted to make a difference , I already had the perfect instrument to do it , that music was the bridge that connected my world and his .
There &apos;s a beautiful quote by the Rom@@ an@@ tic German com@@ poser Robert Sch@@ um@@ an@@ n , who said , &quot; &quot; To send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the du@@ ty of the artist . &quot; &quot; And this is a particularly poign@@ ant quote because Sch@@ um@@ an@@ n himself suffered from schizoph@@ ren@@ ia and died in as@@ y@@ lu@@ m .
And inspired by what I learned from N@@ ath@@ aniel , I started an organization on S@@ kid R@@ ow of musicians called Street Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony , bringing the light of music into the very dark@@ est places , performing for the hom@@ eless and mentally ill at shel@@ ters and clin@@ ics on S@@ kid R@@ ow , performing for combat veter@@ ans with post-@@ traumati@@ c stress disorder , and for the incar@@ cer@@ ated and those lab@@ eled as crimin@@ ally in@@ sane .
After one of our events at the P@@ att@@ on State Ho@@ sp@@ ital in San Ber@@ nar@@ din@@ o , a woman walked up to us and she had tears stre@@ aming down her face , and she had a pal@@ sy , she was sh@@ aking , and she had this gor@@ ge@@ ous smile , and she said that she had never heard class@@ ical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a viol@@ in before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sun@@ shine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped sh@@ aking without medication .
Su@@ dd@@ enly , what we &apos;re finding with these concer@@ ts , away from the stage , away from the foot@@ lights , out of the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do t@@ ails , the musicians become the conduit for deli@@ vering the tremendous therap@@ eu@@ tic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room , would never have access to the kind of music that we make .
Just as medicine ser@@ ves to he@@ al more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music trans@@ c@@ ends the &quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; in the middle of our bel@@ o@@ ved ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m .
Music trans@@ c@@ ends the aes@@ thetic beauty alone .
The synchron@@ y of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by W@@ ag@@ ner , or a symph@@ ony by Bra@@ h@@ ms , or cham@@ ber music by Beethoven , comp@@ els us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply commun@@ al connected consciousness , the empath@@ ic consciousness that neuro@@ psychi@@ atr@@ ist I@@ ain Mc@@ G@@ il@@ ch@@ ris@@ t says is har@@ d-@@ wired into our brain &apos;s right h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere .
And for those living in the most de@@ human@@ izing conditions of mental illness within hom@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and incar@@ cer@@ ation , the music and the beauty of music off@@ ers a chance for them to trans@@ cen@@ d the world around them , to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them .
And the s@@ park of that beauty , the s@@ park of that humanity transform@@ s into hope , and we know , whether we choose the path of music or of medicine , that &apos;s the very first thing we must in@@ still within our communities , within our audiences , if we want to inspire heal@@ ing from within .
I &apos;d like to end with a quote by John Ke@@ ats , the Rom@@ an@@ tic English poet , a very famous quote that I &apos;m sure all of you know .
Ke@@ ats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursu@@ e poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
And Ke@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; Be@@ aut@@ y is truth , and truth beauty .
That is all ye know on Earth , and all ye need to know . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) ( Applause )
Thank you so much everyone from TED , and Chris and A@@ my in particular .
I cannot believe I &apos;m here .
I have not sle@@ pt in weeks .
N@@ eil and I were sitting there compar@@ ing how little we &apos;ve sle@@ pt in anticip@@ ation for this . I &apos;ve never been so nervous — and I do this when I &apos;m nervous , I just realized . ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 8@@ 26 Val@@ enci@@ a , and then I &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
Back in about 2000 , I was living in Brooklyn , I was trying to finish my first book , I was wan@@ dering around d@@ az@@ ed every day because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
So I would walk around in a d@@ az@@ e during the day .
I had no mental acu@@ ity to speak of during the day , but I had flexible hours .
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in , Park S@@ lo@@ pe , there are a lot of writers — it &apos;s like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .
Me@@ an@@ while , I had grown up around a lot of teachers .
My mom was a teacher , my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching .
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and constantly inspiring people I knew .
But I knew so many of the things they were up against , so many of the stru@@ gg@@ les they were dealing with .
And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
Now , so many of these students had come from house@@ holds where English isn &apos;t spoken in the home , where a lot of them have different special needs , learning dis@@ abilities . And of course they &apos;re working in schools which sometimes and very often are under@@ -@@ funded .
And so they would talk to me about this and say , &quot; &quot; You know , what we really need is just more people , more bodies , more one-@@ on-@@ one attention , more hours , more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one-@@ on-@@ one . &quot; &quot; Now , I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-@@ on-@@ one ? &quot; &quot; And they would say , &quot; &quot; Well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
This can lead up to 150 , 1@@ 80 , 200 students a day .
How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-@@ on-@@ one attention ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;d have to gre@@ at@@ ly multi@@ ply the work@@ week and cl@@ one the teachers .
And so we started talking about this .
And at the same time , I thought about this massive group of people I knew : writers , edit@@ ors , journalists , graduate students , assistant profess@@ ors , you name it .
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word — I hope to have an interest in the English language , but I &apos;m not speaking it well right now . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m trying . That clock has got me .
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the prim@@ acy of the written word in terms of nur@@ tur@@ ing a democracy , nur@@ tur@@ ing an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed life .
And so they had , you know , their time and their interest , but at the same time there wasn &apos;t a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together .
So when I moved back to San Francisco , we r@@ ented this building .
And the idea was to put Mc@@ Swe@@ en@@ ey &apos;s — Mc@@ Swe@@ en@@ ey &apos;s Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines — we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn .
We were going to move it into an office , and we were going to actually share space with a tu@@ tor@@ ing center .
So we thought , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have all these writers and edit@@ ors and everybody — sort of a writing community — coming into the office every day anyway , why don &apos;t we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school , get extra help on their written hom@@ ework , so you have basically no border between these two communities ? &quot; &quot; So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood .
So , we had this place , we r@@ ented it , the land@@ l@@ ord was all for it . We did this m@@ ural , that &apos;s a Chris W@@ are m@@ ural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in m@@ ural form — it takes a long time to dig@@ est and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
So we r@@ ented this space .
And everything was great except the land@@ l@@ ord said , &quot; &quot; Well , the space is z@@ oned for ret@@ ail ; you have to come up with something .
You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
You can &apos;t just have a tu@@ tor@@ ing center . &quot; &quot; So we thought , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ha ! Really ! &quot; &quot; And we couldn &apos;t think of anything necessarily to sell , but we did all the necessary research .
It used to be a weight room , so there were rub@@ ber flo@@ ors below , acou@@ stic tile ce@@ il@@ ings and fluor@@ escent lights .
We took all that down , and we found beautiful woo@@ den flo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ e@@ wash@@ ed be@@ ams and it had the look — while we were ren@@ ov@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; You know , it really kind of looks like the h@@ ull of a ship . &quot;
And we looked around and somebody else said , &quot; &quot; Well , you should sell suppl@@ ies to the working buc@@ can@@ e@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And so this is what we did . So it made everybody laugh , and we said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a point to that .
Let &apos;s sell pir@@ ate suppl@@ ies . &quot; &quot; This is the pir@@ ate supply store .
You see , this is sort of a sket@@ ch I did on a n@@ ap@@ kin .
A great car@@ pen@@ ter built all this stuff and you see , we made it look sort of pir@@ ate suppl@@ y-@@ like .
Here you see plan@@ ks sold by the foot and we have suppl@@ ies to combat sc@@ ur@@ v@@ y .
We have the pe@@ g legs there , that are all hand@@ made and f@@ it@@ ted to you .
Up at the top , you see the ey@@ e@@ pat@@ ch display , which is the black colum@@ n there for everyday use for your ey@@ e@@ pat@@ ch , and then you have the pas@@ tel and other colors for ste@@ pping out at night — special occasions , bar mit@@ z@@ v@@ ah@@ s and whatever .
So we opened this place . And this is a v@@ at that we fill with tre@@ a@@ sures that students dig in .
This is re@@ placement eyes in case you lose one .
These are some signs that we have all over the place : &quot; P@@ rac@@ tical Jo@@ king with P@@ ir@@ ates . &quot;
While you &apos;re reading the sign , we pull a ro@@ pe behind the coun@@ ter and eight mo@@ p heads drop on your head .
That was just my one thing — I said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
It became mo@@ p heads . And this is the fish theater , which is just a sal@@ tw@@ ater tank with three seats , and then right behind it we set up this space , which was the tu@@ tor@@ ing center .
So right there is the tu@@ tor@@ ing center , and then behind the cur@@ tain were the Mc@@ Swe@@ en@@ ey &apos;s offices , where all of us would be working on the magazine and book ed@@ iting and things like that .
The kids would come in — or we thought they would come in . I should back up .
We set the place up , we opened up , we spent months and months ren@@ ov@@ ating this place .
We had tables , chairs , computers , everything .
I went to a dot@@ -@@ com auc@@ tion at a Ho@@ li@@ day In@@ n in Pal@@ o Al@@ to and I bought 11 G@@ 4@@ s with a stroke of a p@@ add@@ le .
Anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we wai@@ ted .
It was started with about 12 of my friends , people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood .
And we sat . And at 2 : 30 p@@ .m. we put a sandwich board out on the front side@@ walk and it just said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree Tu@@ tor@@ ing for Your Engl@@ ish@@ -@@ R@@ el@@ ated and W@@ r@@ it@@ ing-@@ R@@ el@@ ated Ne@@ eds — Just Come In , It &apos;s All F@@ ree . &quot; &quot; And we thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re going to storm the g@@ ates , they &apos;re gonna love it . &quot; &quot; And they didn &apos;t .
And so we wai@@ ted , we sat at the tables , we wai@@ ted and wai@@ ted .
And everybody was becoming very dis@@ cour@@ aged because it was weeks and weeks that we wai@@ ted , really , where nobody came in .
And then somebody aler@@ ted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap , because we were operating behind a pir@@ ate supply store . ( Laughter ) We never put it together , you know ?
And so then , around that time , I persu@@ aded a woman named N@@ inev@@ eh Cal@@ ig@@ ari , a long@@ time San Francisco educ@@ ator — she was teaching in Mexico City , she had all the experience necessary , knew everything about education , was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood — I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching .
She took over as execu@@ tive director .
Im@@ medi@@ ately , she made the in@@ roads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything , and so suddenly it was actually full every day .
And what we were trying to offer every day was one-@@ on-@@ one attention .
The goal was to have a one-@@ to-@@ one ratio with every one of these students .
You know , it &apos;s been pro@@ ven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-@@ on-@@ one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
And so most of these students , English is not spoken in the home .
They come there , many times their parents — you can &apos;t see it , but there &apos;s a church pe@@ w that I bought in a Berkeley auc@@ tion right there — the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tu@@ to@@ red .
So that was the basis of it , was one-@@ on-@@ one attention .
And we found ourselves full every day with kids .
If you &apos;re on Val@@ enci@@ a Street within those few blocks at around 2 p@@ .m. , 2 : 30 p@@ .m. , you will get run over , often , by the kids and their big back@@ p@@ acks , or whatever , actually running to this space , which is very strange , because it &apos;s school , in a way .
But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different .
And the other thing was , there was no stig@@ ma .
K@@ ids weren &apos;t going into the &quot; &quot; C@@ enter@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ K@@ id@@ s-@@ Th@@ at-@@ Ne@@ ed@@ -@@ Mo@@ re-@@ Hel@@ p , &quot; &quot; or something like that . It was 8@@ 26 Val@@ enci@@ a .
First of all , it was a pir@@ ate supply store , which is in@@ sane .
And then secon@@ dly , there &apos;s a publ@@ ishing company in the back .
And so our inter@@ ns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoul@@ der@@ -to-@@ shoulder , compu@@ ter-@@ n@@ ex@@ t-@@ to-@@ computer with the students .
And so it became a tu@@ tor@@ ing center — publ@@ ishing center , is what we called it — and a writing center .
They go in , and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel — because we had very gi@@ f@@ ted kids , too .
So there &apos;s no stig@@ ma .
They &apos;re all working next to each other . It &apos;s all a creative end@@ e@@ avor .
They &apos;re seeing adults . They &apos;re mod@@ eling their behavior .
These adults , they &apos;re working in their field .
They can le@@ an over , ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of fe@@ eds on each other .
There &apos;s a lot of cross-@@ pollin@@ ation . The only problem , especially for the adults working at Mc@@ Swe@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bath@@ room . ( Laughter ) With like 60 kids a day , this is a problem .
But you know , there &apos;s something about the kids fin@@ ishing their hom@@ ework in a given day , working one-@@ on-@@ one , getting all this attention — they go home , they &apos;re finished . They don &apos;t st@@ all .
They don &apos;t do their hom@@ ework in front of the TV .
They &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p@@ .m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es , get outside , play .
And that makes a happy family .
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
So the key to it all is hom@@ ework ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There you have it , you know — one-@@ on-@@ one attention .
So we started off with about 12 volunteers , and then we had about 50 , and then a couple hundred .
And we now have 1,@@ 400 volunteers on our ro@@ ster .
And we make it incredibly easy to volunte@@ er .
The key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoul@@ der@@ -to-@@ shoulder , next to one student , concentr@@ ated attention , sh@@ ining this bea@@ m of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-@@ expression , is going to be absolutely transform@@ ative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
So we said , &quot; &quot; Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months , it doesn &apos;t matter . That &apos;s going to be enough . &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s partly why the tu@@ tor corps grew so fast .
Then we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p@@ .m. ? &quot; &quot; So we started bringing in classes during the day .
So every day , there &apos;s a field trip where they together create a book — you can see it being ty@@ ped up above .
This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing .
You just point a camera at a class , and it always looks like this .
So this is one of the books that they do .
No@@ tice the title of the book , &quot; The Bo@@ ok That Was Never Ch@@ ec@@ ked O@@ ut : Tit@@ anic . &quot;
And the first line of that book is , &quot; &quot; Once there was a book named Cin@@ dy that was about the Tit@@ anic . &quot; &quot; So , mean@@ while , there &apos;s an adult in the back ty@@ ping this up , taking it completely seriously , which blo@@ ws their mind .
So then we still had more tu@@ tors to use .
This is a shot of just some of the tu@@ tors during one of the events .
The teachers that we work with — and everything is different to teachers — they tell us what to do .
We went in there thinking , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re ultimately , completely mal@@ le@@ able . You &apos;re going to tell us .
The neighborhood &apos;s going to tell us , the parents are going to tell us .
The teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot; &quot; So then they said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you come into the schools ?
Because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; &quot; So then we started saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve got 1,@@ 400 people on our tu@@ tor ro@@ ster .
Let &apos;s just put out the word . &quot; &quot; A teacher will say , &quot; &quot; I need 12 tu@@ tors for the next five Sun@@ days .
We &apos;re working on our college ess@@ ays . S@@ end them in . &quot; &quot; So we put that out on the wire : 1,@@ 400 tu@@ tors .
Wh@@ o@@ ever can make it signs up . They go in about a half an hour before the class .
The teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
They work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
And that &apos;s actually the br@@ un@@ t of what we do is , people going straight from their work@@ place , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
So then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
Then another school said , &quot; &quot; Well , what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day ? &quot; &quot; So this is the Ever@@ ett Middle School W@@ r@@ it@@ ers &apos; Ro@@ om , where we dec@@ or@@ ated it in buc@@ can@@ e@@ er style .
It &apos;s right off the library . And there we serve all 5@@ 29 kids in this middle school .
This is their newspaper , the &quot; &quot; S@@ trai@@ ght-@@ Up News , &quot; &quot; that has an on@@ going colum@@ n from May@@ or G@@ av@@ in New@@ so@@ m in both languages — English and Spanish .
So then one day Is@@ ab@@ el All@@ en@@ de wrote to us and said , &quot; &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you as@@ sign a book with high school students ?
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world . &quot; &quot; And so we went into Th@@ ur@@ good Mar@@ shall High School , which is a school that we had worked with on some other things , and we gave that assign@@ ment to the students .
And we said , &quot; &quot; Is@@ ab@@ el All@@ en@@ de is going to read all your ess@@ ays at the end .
She &apos;s going to publ@@ ish them in a book .
She &apos;s going to spon@@ sor the printing of this book in pap@@ er@@ back form .
It &apos;s going to be available in all the boo@@ k@@ stores in the Bay A@@ re@@ a and throughout the world , on Amazon and you name it . &quot; &quot; So these kids worked harder than they &apos;ve ever worked on anything in their lives , because there was that outside audience , there was Is@@ ab@@ el All@@ en@@ de on the other end .
I think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ tors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
We had a big party at the end .
This is a book that you can find anywhere . So that led to a series of these .
You can see A@@ my T@@ an spon@@ so@@ red the next one , &quot; I Mi@@ ght Get Some@@ where . &quot;
And this became an on@@ going thing . More and more books .
Now we &apos;re sort of ad@@ dic@@ ted to the book thing .
The kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can dimin@@ ish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve hon@@ ored their words , hon@@ ored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five dra@@ f@@ ts , six dra@@ f@@ ts — all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
And once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
It &apos;s absolutely transform@@ ative .
And so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . This is near the plan@@ ks .
We sell all the student books .
Where else would you put them , right ?
So we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . The store , actually — even though we started out as just a ga@@ g — the store actually made money .
So it was paying the rent .
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t want to judge .
But people would come in — and this was before the pir@@ ate movies and everything !
It was making a lot of money . Not a lot of money , but it was paying the rent , paying a full-@@ time staff member there .
There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
And it became a g@@ at@@ e@@ way to the community .
People would come in and say , &quot; &quot; What the — ?
What is this ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to sw@@ ear on the web . ( Laughter ) Is that a rule ? I don &apos;t know .
They would say , &quot; &quot; What is this ? &quot; &quot; And people would come in and learn more about it .
And then right beyond — there &apos;s usually a little chain there — right beyond , they would see the kids being tu@@ to@@ red .
This is a field trip going on . And so they would be shopping , and they might be more likely to buy some l@@ ard , or mill@@ et for their par@@ ro@@ t , or , you know , a ho@@ ok , or ho@@ ok prot@@ ector for night@@ time , all of these things we sell .
So the store actually did really well .
But it brought in so many people — teachers , don@@ ors , volunteers , everybody — because it was street level . It was open to the public .
It wasn &apos;t a non-@@ profit buried , you know , on the 3@@ 0@@ th floor of some building down@@ town . It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
So , it became this sort of weird , happy accident .
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn , they said , &quot; Well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
And a lot of them had been former educ@@ ators or w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be educ@@ ators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea in@@ depend@@ ently and they did their own thing .
They didn &apos;t want to sell pir@@ ate suppl@@ ies .
They didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
So , knowing the cri@@ me-@@ fighting community in New York , they opened the Brooklyn Super@@ hero Su@@ ppl@@ y Com@@ p@@ any .
This is Sam P@@ ot@@ ts &apos; great design that did this .
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those key@@ sm@@ ith &apos;s shops that has to have every service they &apos;ve ever offered , you know , all over there .
So they opened this place . In@@ side , it &apos;s like a Co@@ st@@ co for super@@ heroes — all the suppl@@ ies in kind of basic form .
These are all hand@@ made .
These are all sort of re@@ pur@@ posed other products , or whatever .
All the pack@@ aging is done by Sam P@@ ot@@ ts .
So then you have the vill@@ ain cont@@ ainment unit , where kids put their parents . You have the office .
This is a little v@@ ault — you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the coun@@ ter tells you that you have to rec@@ ite the vo@@ w of her@@ o@@ ism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . And it limits , really , their sales .
Per@@ son@@ ally , I think it &apos;s a problem .
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything .
These are some of the products . These are all hand@@ made .
This is a secret identity kit .
If you want to take on the identity of S@@ har@@ on Bo@@ one , one American female marketing execu@@ tive from Ho@@ bo@@ ken , New Jersey . It &apos;s a full dossi@@ er on everything you would need to know about S@@ har@@ on Bo@@ one .
So , this is the cap@@ ery where you get f@@ it@@ ted for your cape , and then you walk up these three ste@@ el@@ -@@ grad@@ ed steps and then we turn on three hydr@@ au@@ lic f@@ ans from every side and then you can see the cape in action .
There &apos;s nothing worse than , you know , getting up there and the cape is bun@@ ching up or something like that .
So then , the secret door — this is one of the shel@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grap@@ pling ho@@ o@@ ks .
It opens and then this is the tu@@ tor@@ ing center in the back . ( Applause ) So you can see the full effect !
But this is — I just want to emphas@@ ize — loc@@ ally funded , loc@@ ally built .
All the designers , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-@@ bon@@ o .
I just came and visited and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; &quot; or whatever . That was it . You can see the time in all five bor@@ ough@@ s of New York in the back . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours .
It &apos;s very busy . S@@ ame principles : one-@@ on-@@ one attention , complete dev@@ otion to the students &apos; work and a b@@ ound@@ less optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas .
And this switch is f@@ lic@@ ked in their heads when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store , right ?
So it &apos;s school , but it &apos;s not school .
It &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoul@@ der@@ -to-@@ shoulder on tables , pen@@ c@@ ils and papers , whatever .
This is one of the students , K@@ hal@@ ed H@@ am@@ d@@ an .
You can read this quote .
Ad@@ dic@@ ted to video games and TV . C@@ ouldn &apos;t concentr@@ ate at home .
C@@ ame in . G@@ ot this concentr@@ ated attention .
And he couldn &apos;t escape it .
So , soon enough , he was writing . He would finish his hom@@ ework early — got really ad@@ dic@@ ted to fin@@ ishing his hom@@ ework early .
It &apos;s an ad@@ dic@@ tive thing to sort of be done with it , and to have it chec@@ ked , and to know he &apos;s going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day .
So he got ho@@ o@@ ked on that , and then he started doing other things .
He &apos;s now been published in five books .
He co-@@ wrote a mo@@ ck@@ ument@@ ary about failed super@@ heroes called &quot; &quot; Super@@ -@@ H@@ as-@@ Be@@ ens . &quot; &quot; He wrote a series on &quot; &quot; Pen@@ gu@@ in Bal@@ bo@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is a fighting — a box@@ ing — pengu@@ in .
And then he read al@@ oud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony Space , at a benefit for 8@@ 26 New York . So he &apos;s there every day .
He &apos;s ev@@ ang@@ el@@ ical about it . He brings his cousins in now .
There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
So , I &apos;ll go through really quickly .
This is L.A. , The E@@ ch@@ o Park Time Tr@@ av@@ el M@@ art : &quot; &quot; Wh@@ enever You Are , We &apos;re Al@@ ready Then . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is sort of a 7@@ -@@ El@@ even for time trav@@ el@@ ers .
So you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ El@@ even would be .
Le@@ e@@ ches . M@@ am@@ mot@@ h ch@@ un@@ ks . They even have their own S@@ l@@ ur@@ pe@@ e machine : &quot; &quot; O@@ ut of Or@@ der . Come Back Y@@ esterday . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
These are spaces that are only aff@@ ili@@ ated with us , doing this same thing : Wor@@ d St@@ . in P@@ itt@@ s@@ field , M@@ ass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts ; In@@ k S@@ pot in C@@ inc@@ in@@ nat@@ i ; You@@ th S@@ pea@@ ks , San Francisco , California , which inspired us ; Stu@@ dio St@@ . Lou@@ is in St@@ . Lou@@ is ; Aus@@ tin B@@ at C@@ ave in Aus@@ tin ; F@@ igh@@ ting Wor@@ ds in Du@@ bl@@ in , I@@ rel@@ and , started by R@@ od@@ dy D@@ oy@@ le , this will be open in A@@ pr@@ il .
Now I &apos;m going to the TED W@@ ish — is that okay ?
All right , I &apos;ve got a minute . So , the TED W@@ ish : I wish that you — you personally and every creative individual and organization you know — will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you &apos;ll then tell the story of how you got involved , so that within a year we have a thousand examples — a thousand ! — of transform@@ ative part@@ ner@@ ships .
Pro@@ found le@@ aps forward !
And these can be things that maybe you &apos;re already doing .
I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things .
I know that for a fact . So , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
We created a website .
I &apos;m going to switch to &quot; &quot; we , &quot; &quot; and not &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; hope : We hope that the attend@@ ees of this conference will us@@ her in a new era of participation in our public schools .
We hope that you will take the lead in part@@ ner@@ ing your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educ@@ ators in your community .
Al@@ ways let the teachers lead the way .
They will tell you how to be useful . I hope that you &apos;ll step in and help out .
There are a million ways .
You can walk up to your local school and consul@@ t with the teachers . They &apos;ll always tell you how to help .
So , this is with H@@ ot Stu@@ dio in San Francisco , they did this phenomen@@ al job .
This website is already up , it &apos;s already got a bunch of stories , a lot of ideas . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Once U@@ pon a School , &quot; &quot; which is a great title , I think .
This site will document every story , every project that comes out of this conference and around the world . So you go to the website , you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started .
H@@ ot Stu@@ dio did a great job in a very ti@@ ght dea@@ d@@ line . So , visit the site .
If you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . He &apos;ll be on the phone .
You email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
And he &apos;ll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change .
And it can be fun ! That &apos;s the point of this talk — it nee@@ dn &apos;t be ster@@ ile . It nee@@ dn &apos;t be bureau@@ crati@@ c@@ ally un@@ ten@@ able .
You can do and use the skills that you have .
The schools need you . The teachers need you .
Stu@@ dents and parents need you . They need your actual person : your physical person@@ hood and your open minds and open ears and b@@ ound@@ less compassion , sitting next to them , listening and no@@ dding and asking questions for hours at a time .
Some of these kids just don &apos;t plain know how good they are : how smart and how much they have to say .
You can tell them . You can shine that light on them , one human interaction at a time . So we hope you &apos;ll join us .
Thank you so much .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D.C. , on the 20th annivers@@ ary of Earth Day .
And my family and friends had gather@@ ed there to hear me speak .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ j@@ ah , Johnny ’ s talking ! &quot;
( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laugh@@ ed .
And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our jour@@ neys .
Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
My journey began in 197@@ 1 when I witn@@ essed two oil tan@@ kers col@@ li@@ de bene@@ ath the Gol@@ den G@@ ate , and a half a million g@@ allons of oil sp@@ illed into the b@@ ay .
It distur@@ bed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and driving in motor@@ ized vehicles .
That ’ s a big thing in California .
And it was a big thing in my little community of Point R@@ eyes St@@ ation in In@@ vern@@ ess , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now .
And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the poll@@ lu@@ tion .
And so I argu@@ ed with people about that , I argu@@ ed and I argu@@ ed .
I called my parents up .
I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
They ’ re back in Philadelph@@ ia .
And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ thers are like that .
And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th birthday I decided , because I argu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
And so I did .
I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
And what I heard , it kind of distur@@ bed me .
Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
And in my mind , I just kind of rac@@ ed ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fin@@ ishing up .
And then I would launch in .
Well , that just ended communication .
So on this first day I actually listened .
And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I prom@@ ised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would re@@ ass@@ ess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
Well , that las@@ ted 17 years .
Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the ban@@ j@@ o and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
I walked up to Ash@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on , where they were off@@ ering an environmental studies degree .
It ’ s only 500 miles .
And I went into the Re@@ g@@ istr@@ ar ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
I had a newspaper cli@@ pping .
&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
You don ’ t … ?
We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
And in those two years , I gradu@@ ated with my first degree — a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or ’ s degree .
And my father came out , he was so proud .
He said , &quot; &quot; L@@ isten , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or ’ s degree ?
You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my shoulder , I picked my back@@ pack up again and I started walking .
I walked all the way up to P@@ ort T@@ ow@@ n@@ send , Washington , where I built a woo@@ den boat , ro@@ de it across Pu@@ get S@@ ound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; I@@ d@@ ah@@ o and down to M@@ is@@ sou@@ la , Mont@@ ana .
I had written the University of Mont@@ ana two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
There are two stories in Mont@@ ana .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ g@@ ister for one credit .
You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Ri@@ vers and la@@ kes , the hydro@@ logical systems , South America .
So I did that .
He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve regis@@ tered for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can ma@@ tr@@ icul@@ ate — you ’ re ma@@ tr@@ icul@@ ating , so you can use the library .
And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the profess@@ ors allow you to go to class .
They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can reg@@ ister for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
I explained , with a friend who could interpre@@ t my sign language , that I was John Franc@@ is , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpre@@ ting for me .
All the students sat around and they went ...
( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the s@@ che@@ du@@ le , to see when they could get out .
They had to take that class with me .
Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
and they were all gather@@ ed around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a hand@@ saw . &quot;
&quot; Well , you can ’ t clear@@ cut with a ... &quot;
&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about sel@@ ective for@@ es@@ try . &quot;
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
I just b@@ acked out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the f@@ ists from flying .
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
And so I went on .
My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and driving and start talking .
What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my shoulder , I got my back@@ pack and I went on to the University of W@@ is@@ cons@@ in .
I spent two years there writing on oil sp@@ ills .
No one was interested in oil sp@@ ills .
But something happened — Ex@@ xon Val@@ dez .
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil sp@@ ills .
My dad came out again .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my back@@ pack again .
I put my ban@@ j@@ o on and I walked all the way to the East Co@@ ast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th annivers@@ ary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me speak .
And that ’ s communication .
And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
Well , my journey kept going on .
My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
I worked for the Co@@ ast@@ gu@@ ard , was made a U.N. Goo@@ d@@ will Am@@ bass@@ ad@@ or .
I wrote regul@@ ations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil sp@@ ill regul@@ ations .
20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bud@@ dy . &quot;
How could that be , how could that be ?
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
Well , my time at the Co@@ ast Gu@@ ard was a really good time .
And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a s@@ ail@@ boat and I s@@ ailed down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , and walked through all of the is@@ lands , and to V@@ ene@@ zu@@ ela .
And you know , I for@@ got the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
I started talking because I had studied environment .
I ’ d studied environment at this form@@ al level , but there was this inform@@ al level .
And the inform@@ al level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and end@@ anger@@ ed species to being about how we treated each other .
Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
And so that ’ s the message that I had .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my s@@ ail@@ boat , s@@ ailed all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an — it wasn &apos;t really my s@@ ail@@ boat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to V@@ ene@@ zu@@ ela and I started walking .
This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motor@@ ized vehicles .
I was walking through El D@@ or@@ ado — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or in@@ famous prison — in V@@ ene@@ zu@@ ela , and I don ’ t know what poss@@ essed me , because this was not like me .
There I am , walking past the gu@@ ard gate and the gu@@ ard stops and says , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ a@@ porte , pas@@ a@@ porte , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 16 pointed at me .
And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; Pass@@ port , hu@@ h ?
I don &apos;t need to show you my pass@@ port . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
I &apos;m Dr. Franc@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.N. Am@@ bass@@ ad@@ or and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
What poss@@ essed me to say this thing ?
The road turned into the jungle .
I didn ’ t get shot .
And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — thank God Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a pris@@ oner .
I was a pris@@ oner and I needed to escape .
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motor@@ ized vehicles .
Now how could that be ?
Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motor@@ ized vehicles .
But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Am@@ bass@@ ad@@ or .
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
You know , we can do it .
I was going to have to change .
And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
We have to change now .
As our former V@@ ice President said , we have to become activis@@ ts .
So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , what I &apos;m going to do is just give you the latest ep@@ isode of India &apos;s — maybe the world &apos;s — long@@ est running so@@ ap opera , which is cr@@ ick@@ et .
And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
It &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal so@@ ap opera to want : It &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sad@@ ness , tears , l@@ aughter , lots of dec@@ e@@ it , intr@@ ig@@ ue .
And like all good so@@ aps , it jum@@ ps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
And that &apos;s exactly what cr@@ ick@@ et has done .
It &apos;s jumped 20 years into 20@@ -@@ over game .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution .
But it wasn &apos;t always like that .
Cr@@ ick@@ et wasn &apos;t always this spe@@ ed@@ -@@ driven generations game .
There was a time when you played cr@@ ick@@ et , you played tim@@ eless test mat@@ ches , when you played on till the game got over .
And there was this game in March 193@@ 9 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14@@ th of March .
And it only ended because the English cr@@ ick@@ eters had to go from D@@ urban to C@@ ape T@@ own , which is a two-@@ hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17@@ th , because the next ship wasn &apos;t around for a long time .
So , the match was ended in between .
And one of the English bat@@ sm@@ en said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
Another half an hour and we would have won . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Another half an hour after 12 days .
There were two Sun@@ days in between . But of course , Sun@@ days are church days , so you don &apos;t play on Sun@@ days . And one day it r@@ ained , so they all sat around making friends with each other .
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cr@@ ick@@ et : because we had about the same pace of life .
( Laughter ) The Ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata was like that as well , wasn &apos;t it ?
You fought by day , then it was sun@@ set , so everyone went back home .
And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
The only difference between the Ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata and our cr@@ ick@@ et was that in cr@@ ick@@ et , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .
Pr@@ in@@ ces patr@@ on@@ ize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of in@@ grati@@ ating themselves to the British rul@@ ers .
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cr@@ ick@@ et , which was , all you needed was a plan@@ k of wood and a rub@@ ber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere .
Take a look : You could play it in the dum@@ p with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little al@@ ley — you couldn &apos;t hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; don &apos;t forget the air condi@@ tioning and the cable wires .
( Laughter ) You could play it on the banks of the G@@ ang@@ es — that &apos;s as clean as the G@@ ang@@ es has been for a long time .
Or you could play many games in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
( Laughter ) As you can see , you can play anywhere .
But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
You don &apos;t always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 5@@ 0-@@ over cr@@ ick@@ et .
And then an enormous accident took place .
In Indian sport we don &apos;t make things happen , accidents happen and we &apos;re in the right place at the right time , sometimes .
And we won this World C@@ up in 198@@ 3 .
And suddenly we fell in love with the 5@@ 0-@@ over game , and we played it virtually every day .
There was more 5@@ 0-@@ over cr@@ ick@@ et than anywhere .
But there was another big date .
198@@ 3 was when we won the World C@@ up .
1991 , &apos; 9@@ 2 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of intr@@ ig@@ ue and mystery in this closed country .
And so we allowed multin@@ ation@@ als into India .
We cut cu@@ st@@ oms du@@ ties , we reduced im@@ port du@@ ties , and we got all the multin@@ ation@@ als coming in , with multin@@ ational budgets , who looked at per@@ -@@ capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian .
And there are only two vehicles in India — one real , one scri@@ p@@ ted .
The scri@@ p@@ ted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cr@@ ick@@ et .
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , R@@ av@@ i D@@ h@@ ari@@ w@@ al from Pe@@ p@@ si , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
And Pe@@ p@@ si was this big revolution , because they started taking cr@@ ick@@ et all over .
And so cr@@ ick@@ et started becoming big ; cr@@ ick@@ et started bringing riches in .
T@@ elev@@ ision started covering cr@@ ick@@ et . For a long time television said , &quot; &quot; We won &apos;t cover cr@@ ick@@ et unless you pay us to cover it . &quot; &quot; Then they said , &quot; &quot; OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars .
The next rights are sold for 6@@ 12 million dollars . &quot; &quot; So , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
And then another big accident happened in our cr@@ ick@@ et .
England invented 20 o@@ vers cr@@ ick@@ et , and said , &quot; &quot; The world must play 20 o@@ vers cr@@ ick@@ et . &quot; &quot; Just as England invented cr@@ ick@@ et , and made the rest of the world play it .
Thank God for them .
( Laughter ) And so , India had to go and play the T@@ 20 World C@@ up , you see .
India didn &apos;t want to play the T@@ 20 World C@@ up .
But we were forced to play it by an 8@@ -@@ 1 mar@@ gin .
And then something very dramatic happened .
We got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain en@@ shr@@ ined forever , for everybody , take a look .
( Cro@@ w@@ d che@@ ering ) The Pak@@ ist@@ ani bat@@ sm@@ an trying to clear the fiel@@ der .
An@@ n@@ ounc@@ er : And Z@@ ish@@ an takes it ! India w@@ ins !
What a match for a Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ 20 final .
India , the world champi@@ ons .
( Che@@ ering ) India , T@@ 20 champi@@ ons .
But what a game we had , M. S. D@@ hon@@ i got it right in the air , but M@@ is@@ b@@ ah@@ -@@ ul@@ -@@ H@@ a@@ q , what a player .
A massive , massive success : India , the world T@@ T champi@@ ons .
Har@@ sh@@ a B@@ ho@@ gle : Su@@ dd@@ enly India discovered this power of 20@@ -@@ o@@ vers cr@@ ick@@ et .
The accident , of course , there , was that the bat@@ sm@@ an thought the bo@@ w@@ ler was bo@@ w@@ ling fast .
( Laughter ) If he had bo@@ w@@ led fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
And what it also did was it led to a certain pri@@ de in the fact that India could be the best in the world .
It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confident about itself .
And so there was a feeling that there was great pri@@ de in what we can do .
And th@@ ank@@ fully for all of us , the English are very good at invent@@ ing things , and then the gr@@ ac@@ ious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
( Laughter ) And so England invented T@@ 20 cr@@ ick@@ et , and allowed India to hi@@ j@@ ack it .
It was not like re@@ engineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
( Laughter ) And so , we launched our own T@@ 20 le@@ ague .
Six weeks , city versus city .
It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country — the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , repres@@ enting itself on the field .
One was war , the Indian army , which we don &apos;t like to happen very often .
The other was Indian cr@@ ick@@ et .
Now , suddenly we had to support city le@@ agues .
But the people getting into these city le@@ agues were people who were taking their cu@@ es from the West .
America is a home of le@@ agues . And they said , &quot; Right , we &apos;ll build some g@@ lit@@ zy le@@ agues here in India . &quot;
But was India ready for it ?
Because cr@@ ick@@ et , for a long time in India was always organized .
It was never prom@@ oted , it was never sold — it was organized .
And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game .
All of a sudden , you had that happening .
( Music ) An opening cerem@@ ony to match every other .
This was an India that was buying Cor@@ v@@ ettes . This was an India that was buying J@@ agu@@ ar .
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Ze@@ al@@ and &apos;s population twice over .
So , it was a different India .
But it was also a slightly more or@@ tho@@ do@@ x India that was very happy to be modern , but didn &apos;t want to say that to people .
And so , they were ag@@ h@@ ast when the che@@ er@@ leaders arrived .
Everyone sec@@ ret@@ ly watched them , but everyone cl@@ aimed not to .
( Music ) ( Laughter ) The new ow@@ ners of Indian cr@@ ick@@ et were not the old prin@@ ces .
They were not bureau@@ cr@@ ats who were forced into sport because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
And so they started prom@@ oting cr@@ ick@@ et big time , started prom@@ oting clubs big time .
And they &apos;ve started prom@@ oting them with huge money behind it .
I mean the I@@ P@@ L had 2.@@ 3 billion dollars before a ball was bo@@ w@@ led , 1.@@ 6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franch@@ ises that were putting in money . And then they had to appe@@ al to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up le@@ agues .
But what they were very good at doing was making it very loc@@ alized .
So , just to give you an example of how they did it — not Man@@ ches@@ ter United style prom@@ otion , but very Mumbai style prom@@ otion . Take a look .
( Music ) Of course , a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Maybe they dance better than they play . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But that &apos;s all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cr@@ ick@@ et .
All along , if you wanted a young cr@@ ick@@ eter , you picked him up from the by@@ lan@@ es of your own little loc@@ ality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cr@@ ick@@ eters .
Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bo@@ wl a shot — if Mumbai were to bo@@ wl a shot , for example , they nee@@ dn &apos;t go to K@@ al@@ bad@@ ev@@ i or Shi@@ v@@ aj@@ i Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Tr@@ in@@ id@@ ad .
This was the new India , wasn &apos;t it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
And all of a sudden , Indian sport had aw@@ ak@@ ened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
So , the Mumbai Indi@@ ans flew in D@@ w@@ ay@@ ne Br@@ av@@ o from Tr@@ in@@ id@@ ad and T@@ ob@@ ago , over@@ night . And when he had to go back to represent the West In@@ dies , they asked him , &quot; &quot; When do you have to reach ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no . It &apos;s not about when you have to leave ; it &apos;s about when do you have to reach there ? &quot; &quot; And so he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to reach on date X@@ . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; F@@ ine , you play to date X , min@@ us one . &quot; &quot; So , he played in Hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , went , straight after the game ,
went from the st@@ adi@@ um to Hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad airport , sat in a private corporate jet — first refu@@ eling in Portu@@ gal , second refu@@ eling in Brazil ; he was in West In@@ dies in time .
( Laughter ) Never would India have thought on this scale before .
Never would India have said , &quot; &quot; I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to K@@ ing@@ ston , Jam@@ ai@@ ca to play a game . &quot; &quot; And I just thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Wow , we &apos;ve arrived somewhere in the world , you know ?
We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . &quot; &quot; But what this also did was it started mar@@ rying the two most important things in Indian cr@@ ick@@ et , which is cr@@ ick@@ et and the movies in Indian entertainment .
There is cr@@ ick@@ et and the movies .
And they came together because people in the movies now started ow@@ ning clubs .
And so , people started going to the cr@@ ick@@ et to watch P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a .
They started going to the cr@@ ick@@ et to watch Sh@@ ah Ru@@ k@@ h Kh@@ an .
And something very interesting happened .
We started getting song and dance in Indian cr@@ ick@@ et .
And so it started res@@ embl@@ ing the Indian movies more and more .
And of course , if you were on P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a &apos;s team — as you will see on the clip that fol@@ lows — if you did well , you got a hu@@ g from P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a .
So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look — everyone &apos;s watching P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a .
( Music ) And then of course there was Sh@@ ah Ru@@ k@@ h playing the K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata crowd .
We &apos;d all seen mat@@ ches in K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : Sh@@ ah Ru@@ k@@ h , with the B@@ eng@@ al@@ i song , getting the audiences all worked up for K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata — not for India , but for K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata .
But take a look at this .
( Music ) An Indian film star hu@@ gging a Pak@@ ist@@ ani cr@@ ick@@ eter because they &apos;d won in K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata .
Can you imagine ?
And do you know what the Pak@@ ist@@ ani cr@@ ick@@ eter said ?
( Applause ) &quot; I wish I was playing for P@@ re@@ ity Z@@ int@@ a &apos;s team . &quot;
( Laughter ) But I thought I &apos;d take this opportunity — there &apos;s a few people from Pakistan in here .
I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
We can play cr@@ ick@@ et together , we can be friends .
So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan .
( Applause ) There was cri@@ tic@@ ism too because they said , &quot; &quot; Pl@@ ay@@ ers are being bought and sold ?
Are they grain ?
Are they cat@@ tle ? &quot; &quot; Because we had this auc@@ tion , you see .
How do you fix a price for a player ?
And so the auc@@ tion that followed literally had people saying , &quot; Bang ! so many million dollars for so-@@ and-@@ so player . &quot;
There it is .
( Music ) Auc@@ tion@@ e@@ er : Go@@ ing at 1,@@ 5@@ 00,000 dollars . Ch@@ enn@@ ai .
Sh@@ ane War@@ ne sold for 4@@ 50,000 dollars .
H@@ B : Su@@ dd@@ enly , a game which ear@@ ned its players 50 ru@@ pe@@ es a day — so 250 ru@@ pe@@ es for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
The best Indian players who played every test match — every one of the internation@@ als , the top of the line players — standard contr@@ acts are 2@@ 20,000 dollars in a whole year .
Now they were getting 5@@ 00,000 for six days &apos; work .
Then Andrew F@@ lin@@ to@@ ff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , &quot; &quot; For four weeks , I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than Frank L@@ am@@ par@@ d and Steven Ger@@ r@@ ard , and I &apos;m ear@@ ning more than the foot@@ ball@@ ers , w@@ ow . &quot; &quot; And where was he ear@@ ning it from ? From a little club in India .
Could you have imagined that day would come ?
One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
So , at 2.@@ 3 billion dollars before the first ball was bo@@ w@@ led .
What India was doing , though , was ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
L@@ al@@ it Mo@@ di was on the cover of Bus@@ iness Today .
I@@ P@@ L became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tour@@ nam@@ ent in three weeks .
Mo@@ ve a whole tour@@ nam@@ ent to South Africa in three weeks .
But we did it . You know why ?
Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .
( Applause ) Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest ass@@ et because there were more people watching — the huge consum@@ ing class — everybody came to watch the cr@@ ick@@ et .
We &apos;d also made cr@@ ick@@ et the only sport in India , which is a p@@ ity , but in India every other sport push@@ es cr@@ ick@@ et to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .
Now , this last minute before I go — there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
For a long time , India was this country of poverty , dust , beg@@ gars , sn@@ ake char@@ mers , fil@@ th , Delhi bel@@ ly — people heard Delhi bel@@ ly stories before they came .
And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity .
Cr@@ ick@@ eters all over the world said , &quot; You know , we love India . We love to play in India . &quot;
And that felt good , you know ?
We said , &quot; &quot; The dollar &apos;s quite powerful actually . &quot; &quot; Can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no Delhi bel@@ ly in there anymore .
There &apos;s no fil@@ th , there &apos;s no beg@@ gars , all the sn@@ ake char@@ mers have van@@ ished , everybody &apos;s gone . This tells you how the capitalis@@ t world rules .
Right so , finally , an English game that India u@@ sur@@ ped a little bit , but T@@ 20 is going to be the next mis@@ sion@@ ary in the world .
If you want to take the game around the world , it &apos;s got to be the shor@@ test form of the game .
You can &apos;t take a tim@@ eless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you can &apos;t take it all over the world .
So that &apos;s what T@@ 20 is doing .
H@@ op@@ efully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cr@@ ick@@ et comment@@ ators more time in the business .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
( Applause )
So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Ex@@ cuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is O@@ ak Street , that &apos;s El@@ m Street .
This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
Stre@@ ets have names ; blocks are just the un@@ named spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disap@@ pointed .
So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ cuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ lock 17 and this is B@@ lock 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
B@@ loc@@ ks have names .
Just look at Google M@@ aps here . There &apos;s B@@ lock 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the un@@ named spaces in between the blocks .
And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is D@@ istr@@ ic@@ t E@@ ight .
There &apos;s B@@ lock 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the down@@ beat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
So , you can hear it not just in the phr@@ asing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
And this map is also accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
D@@ om@@ o ar@@ ig@@ a@@ to go@@ z@@ ai@@ mas@@ h@@ ita .
Who bomb@@ ed your house ?
Who killed your son ?
Did the rest of your family make it out alive ?
How are you cop@@ ing in your life in ex@@ ile ?
What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bomb@@ s were explo@@ ding in your town , and the armed gang@@ s were approach@@ ing your house ?
A Sy@@ ri@@ an refugee boy I know told me that he didn &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate when his life was in im@@ min@@ ent danger .
He took his high school diplom@@ a , and later he told me why .
He said , &quot; &quot; I took my high school diplom@@ a because my life depend@@ ed on it . &quot; &quot; And he would risk his life to get that diplom@@ a .
On his way to school , he would do@@ dge sni@@ pers .
His classroom sometimes sho@@ ok with the sound of bomb@@ s and sh@@ elling , and his mother told me , &quot; &quot; Every day , I would say to him every morning , &apos; Hon@@ ey , please don &apos;t go to school . &apos; &quot; &quot; And when he ins@@ isted , she said , &quot; I would hu@@ g him as if it were for the last time . &quot;
But he said to his mother , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re all afraid , but our determin@@ ation to graduate is stronger than our fear . &quot; &quot; But one day , the family got terrible news .
It was time to fle@@ e .
And they would cross the border into Le@@ ban@@ on , where they would find peace .
But they would begin a life of gr@@ u@@ eling hard@@ ship and mon@@ ot@@ ony .
And that day , they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world , in a country , Le@@ ban@@ on , that is tiny .
It only has four million citizens , and there are one million Sy@@ ri@@ an refugees living there .
There &apos;s not a town , a city or a village that is not host to Sy@@ ri@@ an refugees .
This is gener@@ os@@ ity and humanity that is remarkable .
Think about it this way , propor@@ tion@@ ately .
It would be as if the entire population of Germany , 80 million people , would fle@@ e to the United States in just three years .
Over and well over three million people have cross@@ ed the borders and have found sanc@@ tu@@ ary in the neighbor@@ ing countries , and only a small proportion , as you see , have moved on to Europe .
What I find most wor@@ rying is that half of all Sy@@ ri@@ an refugees are children .
I took this picture of this little girl .
It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long tre@@ k from Sy@@ ria into J@@ ord@@ an .
And most trou@@ bling of all is that only 20 percent of Sy@@ ri@@ an refugee children are in school in Le@@ ban@@ on .
And yet , Sy@@ ri@@ an refugee children , all refugee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives .
Why ? Because it allows them to think of their future rather than the night@@ ma@@ re of their past .
It allows them to think of hope rather than hat@@ red .
I think she couldn &apos;t , because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Sy@@ ri@@ an refugee children , a generation isolated and frustrated .
And yet , look at what they fl@@ ed : ut@@ ter destruction , buildings , industries , schools , roads , homes .
H@@ any &apos;s home was also destroyed .
This will need to be re@@ built by architects , by engineers , by electr@@ icians .
Com@@ m@@ uni@@ ties will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in re@@ conc@@ iliation and not reven@@ ge .
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es have a lot of time to prepare for their return .
You might imagine that being a refugee is just a tempor@@ ary state .
Well far from it .
With wars going on and on , the average time a refugee will spend in ex@@ ile is 17 years .
H@@ any was into his second year in lim@@ bo when I went to visit him recently , and we conduc@@ ted our entire conversation in English , which he conf@@ essed to me he learned from reading all of Dan Brown &apos;s nov@@ els and from listening to American rap .
We also spent some nice moments of l@@ aughter and fun with his bel@@ o@@ ved brother Ash@@ ra@@ f .
He said to me , &quot; If I am not a student , I am nothing . &quot;
H@@ any is one of 50 million people u@@ pro@@ oted in this world today .
Never since World War II have so many people been for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ placed .
So while we &apos;re making s@@ wee@@ ping progress in human health , in technology , in education and design , we are doing danger@@ ously little to help the victims and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes .
And there are more and more victims .
Every day , on average , by the end of this day , 3@@ 2,000 people will be for@@ ci@@ bly dis@@ placed from their homes — 3@@ 2,000 people .
They fle@@ e across borders like this one .
We captured this on the Sy@@ ri@@ an border to J@@ ord@@ an , and this is a typical day .
Or they fle@@ e on un@@ sea@@ worthy and over@@ crow@@ ded bo@@ ats , ris@@ king their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe .
How about a place of heal@@ ing , of learning , and even opportunity ?
Americans and Europe@@ ans have the impression that propor@@ tionally huge numbers of refugees are coming to their country , but the reality is that 8@@ 6 percent , the vast majority of refugees , are living in the developing world , in countries struggling with their own insec@@ urity , with their own issues of helping their own populations and poverty .
So weal@@ thy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the gener@@ os@@ ity of the countries that are ho@@ sting so many refugees .
And all countries should make sure that no one fle@@ eing war and pers@@ ec@@ ution arri@@ ves at a closed border .
( Applause ) Thank you .
We can help them thri@@ ve .
We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just tempor@@ ary population centers where people langu@@ ish waiting for the war to end .
Ra@@ ther , as centers of excell@@ ence , where refugees can tri@@ um@@ ph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation .
It makes so much sense , but I &apos;m reminded of the terrible war in Som@@ alia that has been r@@ aging on for 22 years .
And imagine living in this camp .
I visited this camp .
And I also thought , what a waste .
She should be and she is the future of Som@@ alia .
A boy named Jac@@ o@@ b A@@ te@@ m had a different chance , but not before he experienced terri@@ bly tragedy .
He watched — this is in Su@@ d@@ an — as his village — he was only seven years old — bur@@ ned to the ground , and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day .
But his life changed when he got the chance to be res@@ et@@ tled to the United States , and he found love in a fo@@ ster family and he was able to go to school , and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he gradu@@ ated from university .
( Applause ) I spoke to him on Sky@@ pe the other day , and he was in his new university in Florida pursu@@ ing his Ph.D. in public health , and he prou@@ dly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the American public to establ@@ ish a health clinic back in his village back home .
So I want to take you back to H@@ any .
He wrote : &quot; &quot; I miss myself , my friends , times of reading nov@@ els or writing po@@ ems , birds and tea in the morning .
My room , my books , myself , and everything that was making me smile .
Oh , oh , I had so many dreams that were about to be realized . &quot; &quot; So here is my point : Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity .
Le@@ ave them aband@@ oned , and they risk exploitation and abuse , and leave them un@@ sk@@ illed and un@@ educated , and del@@ ay by years the return to peace and prosper@@ ity in their countries .
I believe how we treat the u@@ pro@@ oted will shape the future of our world .
The victims of war can hold the keys to las@@ ting peace , and it &apos;s the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence .
H@@ any is at a ti@@ pping point .
We would love to help him go to university and to become an engineer , but our funds are pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed for the bas@@ ics in life : t@@ ents and blan@@ kets and mat@@ tr@@ esses and kitchen sets , food r@@ ations and a bit of medicine .
University is a lux@@ ury .
But leave him to langu@@ ish in this mu@@ d@@ dy field , and he will become a member of a lost generation .
H@@ any &apos;s story is a tragedy , but it doesn &apos;t have to end that way .
Thank you .
( Applause )
B@@ eli@@ eve me or not , I come off@@ ering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requ@@ is@@ ite focus on climate .
And the solution I offer is to the biggest cul@@ pr@@ it in this massive m@@ ist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of the earth by human@@ kind , and the resul@@ ting decline of the bio@@ sphere .
That cul@@ pr@@ it is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my gradu@@ ation from Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a T@@ ech in 195@@ 6 .
As an industrial engineer , cu@@ m aspir@@ ing and then successful entrepreneur .
After f@@ ounding my company , Inter@@ face , from scratch in 197@@ 3 , 36 years ago , to produce car@@ pet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and she@@ pher@@ ding it through star@@ t-@@ up and survival to prosper@@ ity and global domin@@ ance in its field , I read Paul Haw@@ ken &apos;s book , &quot; The E@@ colo@@ gy of Com@@ mer@@ ce , &quot; the summer of 1994 .
In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major cul@@ pr@@ it in causing the decline of the bio@@ sphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and per@@ vas@@ ive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead human@@ kind out of this mess .
And by the way he convic@@ ted me as a pl@@ under@@ er of the earth .
And I then challeng@@ ed the people of Inter@@ face , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ eu@@ m@@ -@@ intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be ren@@ e@@ wed by the earth , naturally and rapidly — not another fresh drop of oil — and to do no harm to the bio@@ sphere .
Take nothing : do no harm .
I simply said , &quot; &quot; If Haw@@ ken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ?
Un@@ less somebody leads , nobody will . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ax@@ i@@ om@@ atic . Why not us ?
And thanks to the people of Inter@@ face , I have become a reco@@ vering pl@@ under@@ er .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I once told a For@@ tune Mag@@ az@@ ine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
And that became the head@@ line of a For@@ tune article .
They went on to describe me as America &apos;s green@@ est CEO .
From pl@@ under@@ er to reco@@ vering pl@@ under@@ er , to America &apos;s green@@ est CEO in five years — that , frankly , was a pretty sad comment@@ ary on American CE@@ Os in 1999 .
As@@ ked later in the Can@@ adi@@ an document@@ ary , &quot; &quot; The Cor@@ por@@ ation , &quot; &quot; what I meant by the &quot; &quot; go to jail &quot; &quot; remar@@ k , I offered that the@@ ft is a crime .
And the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
But I realized , for that to be true — for the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime — there must be a clear , demonstr@@ able alternative to the ta@@ ke@@ -@@ ma@@ ke@@ -@@ waste industrial system that so domin@@ ates our civilization , and is the major cul@@ pr@@ it , ste@@ aling our children &apos;s future , by di@@ gging up the earth and conver@@ ting it to products that quickly become waste in a land@@ fill or an inc@@ iner@@ ator — in short , di@@ gging up the earth and conver@@ ting it to pollution .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Paul and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch and a well-@@ known environmental impact equation , impact — a bad thing — is the product of population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology .
That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their aff@@ lu@@ ence , and how it is produced .
And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quanti@@ fy people , and perhaps quanti@@ fy aff@@ lu@@ ence , but technology is ab@@ u@@ sive in too many ways to quanti@@ fy .
So the equation is concep@@ tual .
S@@ till it works to help us understand the problem .
So we set out at Inter@@ face , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made car@@ pet , a pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ eu@@ m@@ -@@ intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they dimin@@ ished environmental impact , rather than multipl@@ ied it .
Paul and An@@ ne E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch &apos;s environmental impact equation : I is equal to P times A times T : population , aff@@ lu@@ ence and technology .
I wanted Inter@@ face to re@@ write that equation so that it read I equ@@ als P times A divided by T.
Now , the mathem@@ ati@@ call@@ y-@@ min@@ ded will see immediately that T in the numer@@ ator increases impact — a bad thing — but T in the den@@ omin@@ ator dec@@ reas@@ es impact .
So I ask , &quot; &quot; What would move T , technology , from the numer@@ ator — call it T@@ 1 — where it increases impact , to the den@@ omin@@ ator — call it T@@ 2 — where it re@@ du@@ ces impact ?
I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T@@ 1 , as we practic@@ ed it at Inter@@ face , and it had the following characteristics .
Ex@@ tr@@ active : taking raw materials from the earth .
Lin@@ ear : take , make , waste .
Power@@ ed by fossil fu@@ el@@ -@@ der@@ ived energy .
W@@ as@@ te@@ ful : ab@@ u@@ sive and focused on labor productivity .
More car@@ pet per man@@ -@@ hour .
Th@@ inking it through , I realized that all those attribu@@ tes must be changed to move T to the den@@ omin@@ ator .
In the new industrial revolution extr@@ active must be replaced by renew@@ able ; linear by cy@@ cli@@ cal ; fossil fuel energy by renew@@ able energy , sunlight ; was@@ te@@ ful by was@@ te-@@ free ; and ab@@ u@@ sive by ben@@ ign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
And I reas@@ oned that if we could make those transform@@ ative changes , and get rid of T@@ 1 al@@ together , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate .
And that became the Inter@@ face plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
We have measured our progress very ri@@ gor@@ ously .
So I can tell you how far we have come in the en@@ su@@ ing 12 years .
N@@ et greenhouse gas emissions down 8@@ 2 percent in absolute tonn@@ age .
( Applause ) Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-@@ thirds and profits have doubl@@ ed .
So an 8@@ 2 percent absolute reduction transl@@ ates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas inten@@ sity relative to sales .
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global tech@@ no@@ sphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophi@@ c climate dis@@ ru@@ ption — so the scientists are telling us .
F@@ os@@ si@@ l fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to effici@@ encies in renew@@ ables .
The che@@ ap@@ est , most secure bar@@ rel of oil there is is the one not used through effici@@ encies .
W@@ ater usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide car@@ pet tile business .
D@@ own 40 percent in our broad@@ loo@@ m car@@ pet business , which we acqui@@ red in 1993 right here in California , City of Indus@@ try , where water is so preci@@ ous .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able or recycl@@ able materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent .
We have diver@@ ted 14@@ 8 million pounds — that &apos;s 7@@ 4,000 tons — of used car@@ pet from land@@ f@@ ills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse log@@ istics and post-@@ consumer recycl@@ ing technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
Those new cy@@ cli@@ cal technologies have contribu@@ ted mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square y@@ ards of cli@@ mat@@ e-@@ neutr@@ al car@@ pet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate dis@@ ru@@ ption in producing the car@@ pet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end@@ -@@ of-@@ life re@@ clam@@ ation — independent thir@@ d-@@ party certi@@ fied .
We call it Co@@ ol Car@@ pet .
And it has been a powerful market@@ place differenti@@ ator , increasing sales and profits .
Three years ago we launched car@@ pet tile for the home , under the brand F@@ lo@@ r , mis@@ sp@@ elled F@@ -@@ L@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ R .
You can point and click today at Flor@@ .com and have Co@@ ol Car@@ pet delivered to your front door in five days .
It is practical , and pretty too .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We rec@@ k@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
We &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the sum@@ mit of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability .
We call this M@@ ission Zero .
And this is perhaps the most important fac@@ et : we have found M@@ ission Zero to be incredibly good for business .
A better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
Here is the business case for sustainability .
From real life experience , costs are down , not up , refl@@ ecting some 400 million dollars of avo@@ ided costs in pur@@ suit of zero waste — the first face of M@@ oun@@ t Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability .
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Inter@@ face .
And this dis@@ p@@ els a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy .
Our products are the best they &apos;ve ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected well@@ spring of innovation .
Our people are gal@@ van@@ ized around this shared higher purpose .
You cannot beat it for attr@@ acting the best people and bringing them together .
And the good@@ will of the market@@ place is astonishing .
No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much good@@ will .
C@@ os@@ ts , products , people , market@@ places — what else is there ?
It is a better business model .
And here is our 14@@ -@@ year record of sales and profits .
There is a di@@ p there , from 2001 to 2003 : a di@@ p when our sales , over a three-@@ year period , were down 17 percent .
But the market@@ place was down 36 percent .
We literally g@@ ained market share .
We might not have survived that rec@@ ession but for the adv@@ antages of sustainability .
If every business were pursu@@ ing Inter@@ face plans , would that solve all our problems ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I remain trou@@ bled by the re@@ vis@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equation , I equ@@ als P times A divided by T@@ 2 .
That A is a capital A , suggesting that aff@@ lu@@ ence is an end in itself .
But what if we re@@ fram@@ ed E@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch further ?
And what if we made A a lo@@ wer@@ case &apos; a , &apos; suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness — more happiness with less stuff .
You know that would re@@ frame civilization itself — ( Applause ) — and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succe@@ eds us : the sustainable species , living on a fin@@ ite earth , eth@@ ically , happ@@ ily and ec@@ olog@@ ically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations — that is to say , into the in@@ defin@@ ite future .
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
Well maybe so . But I don &apos;t think so .
At Inter@@ face we really inten@@ d to bring this prototy@@ pical sustainable , zero-@@ footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 .
We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain .
And now the challenge is in exec@@ ution .
And as my good friend and advis@@ er Am@@ ory Lo@@ v@@ ins says , &quot; If something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
( Laughter ) If we can actually do it , it must be possible .
If we , a pe@@ tro@@ -@@ intensive company can do it , anybody can .
And if anybody can , it fol@@ lows that everybody can .
Haw@@ ken ful@@ filled business and industry , leading human@@ kind away from the aby@@ ss because , with continued un@@ chec@@ ked decline of the bio@@ sphere , a very d@@ ear person is at risk here — frankly , an un@@ acceptable risk .
Who is that person ?
Not you . Not I.
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .
On a Tu@@ es@@ day morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .
But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Gl@@ en@@ n Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting .
He was sending me an original poem that he had com@@ posed after our Tu@@ es@@ day morning together .
And when I read it it was one of the most u@@ pli@@ f@@ ting moments of my life .
Because it told me , by God , one person got it .
Here is what Gl@@ en@@ n wrote . And here is that person , most at risk .
Please meet &quot; &quot; Tom@@ orrow &apos;s Child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Without a name , an un@@ seen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tom@@ orrow &apos;s child , though yet un@@ born , I met you first last Tu@@ es@@ day mor@@ n .
A wise friend introduced us two .
And through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
K@@ no@@ wing you has changed my thinking .
For I never had an in@@ k@@ ling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threat@@ en you .
Tom@@ orrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should .
Be@@ gin , I will .
The way the cost of what I squ@@ ander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . &quot; &quot; Well , every day of my life since , &quot; &quot; Tom@@ orrow &apos;s Child &quot; &quot; has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I pres@@ u@@ me to share with you .
We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life .
The continu@@ um of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
For you , it &apos;s your call .
Thank you .
