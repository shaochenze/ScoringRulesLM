By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that activ@@ ely use social net@@ working sites .
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
While that might be a somewhat mor@@ bi@@ d thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
What first got me thinking about this was a blog post au@@ tho@@ red earlier this year by Derek K. M@@ iller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
And what M@@ iller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shor@@ tly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the pun@@ ish@@ ments of my cancer , then my family and friends publ@@ ish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an arch@@ ive . &quot; &quot; Now , while as a journalist , M@@ iller &apos;s arch@@ ive may have been better written and more carefully cur@@ ated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an arch@@ ive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
Consi@@ der a few st@@ ats for a moment .
Right now there are 48 hours of video being uplo@@ aded to YouTube every single minute .
There are 200 million T@@ we@@ ets being posted every day .
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
So when you think about your parents or your grand@@ parents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a di@@ ary that lives in a box somewhere .
But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital arch@@ ive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud in@@ definitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intrigu@@ ing opportunities for technolo@@ g@@ ists .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technolo@@ g@@ ist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online pro@@ file and our social media accoun@@ ts after we die .
One of them actually , f@@ itt@@ ingly enough , found me when I chec@@ ked into a del@@ i at a restaurant in New York on four@@ square .
( Rec@@ or@@ ding ) Adam O@@ str@@ ow : Hello .
De@@ ath : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
De@@ ath : De@@ ath can catch you anywhere , any@@ time , even at the Organ@@ ic .
AO : Who is this ?
De@@ ath : Go to ifi@@ di@@ e@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) Adam O@@ str@@ ow : K@@ ind of cre@@ ep@@ y , right ?
So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
Another service right now is called 1,000 M@@ em@@ ories .
And what this lets you do is create an online tribu@@ te to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with De@@ b Ro@@ y who , back in March , demonstr@@ ated how he was able to analyze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video .
I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content — the T@@ we@@ ets , the photos , the videos , the blog pos@@ ts — that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital person@@ as to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vas@@ t@@ ness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
One service called My Next T@@ we@@ et analy@@ zes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat com@@ ical .
You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
T@@ aking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where C@@ N@@ N be@@ amed a live ho@@ lo@@ gram of hip hop artist w@@ ill@@ .@@ i@@ .@@ am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Co@@ op@@ er .
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to bea@@ m a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lif@@ eli@@ ke way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponenti@@ ally .
Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
Thank you very much .

This dis@@ connect is a problem that I &apos;m trying to help solve .
Now , successful rel@@ aun@@ chers are everywhere and in every field .
This is S@@ ami K@@ af@@ ala .
And this is T@@ rac@@ y S@@ hap@@ ir@@ o , who took a 13@@ -@@ year career break .
The first thing I told T@@ rac@@ y was she had to get out of the house .
This is me , crazy after a day of driving around in my min@@ iv@@ an .
There &apos;s one more thing I remember vivi@@ dly from my own career break .
I had done my financial analysis so long ago that I used L@@ ot@@ us 1@@ -@@ 2@@ -@@ 3 .
Back in 2010 I started notic@@ ing something .

So I wan@@ dered down the hall@@ way to my colleague Chris H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s office .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never offered it .
There were literally thousands of pat@@ ents on human genes .
So we set out to build our case .
This is K@@ ath@@ le@@ en M@@ ax@@ ian .
The test was negative .
S@@ ort of .
En@@ ds up split decision , 2 to 1 .
We sub@@ mitted perhaps the shor@@ test question presented ever .
I was clearly more nervous than he was .
The argument itself was riv@@ eting .
Chris argu@@ ed brilli@@ antly .
Jus@@ tice Rob@@ er@@ ts distingu@@ ished it from car@@ ving a baseball bat from a tree .
But of course the decision goes far beyond My@@ ri@@ ad .
The second quote is from the head of the U@@ K Fin@@ anci@@ al Ser@@ v@@ ices Au@@ th@@ ority .
Unfortunately , the answer is yes .
Then , predictions can be made and tested .
So what do we know about complex systems ?
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
Where are economic networks ?
What we looked at in detail was ow@@ nership networks .
And we also as@@ sign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
How are they organized ? Are they isolated ?
These are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 4@@ 3,000 .
Let me explain by giving you this analo@@ gy .
Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glim@@ p@@ ses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Dan@@ ish artist So@@ ren P@@ ors .
We call ourselves P@@ ors and Ra@@ o , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s pec@@ uli@@ ar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigar@@ ettes .
And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a resp@@ ected figure in the Indian family .
And the situation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fied me the most was his use of a land@@ line telephone .
He would hold on to the rece@@ i@@ ver and expect me to di@@ al a number for him .
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his comm@@ ands .
And so I made him a golden ty@@ pe@@ writer through which he could dis@@ pense his comm@@ ands to ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws and ni@@ eces around the world as an email .
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the car@@ riage , type his email or command and pull the paper out .
This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that underst@@ ands all of the mechanical actions and conver@@ ts it to digital .
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritu@@ alism , the way my uncle likes it .
The next work is a soun@@ d-@@ sensitive installation that we affec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ yg@@ mi@@ es . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tri@@ be of very sh@@ y , sensitive and sweet creatures .
So how it works is we have these pan@@ els , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of cre@@ ep out .
And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stret@@ ch their nec@@ ks out .
And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hide back again .
So we had these pan@@ els on three walls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little py@@ g@@ mi@@ es hi@@ ding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototype .
So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the pan@@ els .
And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
So they get immune to sounds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
( No@@ ise ) But they react to fore@@ ground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Wh@@ ist@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as lif@@ eli@@ ke as possible .
So each py@@ g@@ my has its own behavior , psy@@ che , mo@@ od sw@@ ings , person@@ alities and so on .
So this is a very early prototype .
Of course , it got much better after that .
And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite play@@ ful and child@@ like with them .
This is a video installation called &quot; &quot; The Miss@@ ing Per@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigu@@ ed with playing with the notion of in@@ visi@@ bility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ visi@@ bility ?
So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rend@@ ering them invisible .
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
On the right side you can see my colleague So@@ ren , who &apos;s actually in the space .
And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the proc@@ essed video where the camera has made him invisible .
So@@ ren en@@ ters the room . P@@ op ! He goes invisible .
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and er@@ asing .
It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet de@@ al@@ t with the over@@ lap and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty soon , later .
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Sh@@ ado@@ w . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cu@@ tout of a child@@ like drawing of an oil sp@@ ill or a sun .
And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and robust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some cr@@ ap l@@ aying around .
But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in j@@ er@@ ky fashion .
And it would get ex@@ hau@@ sted , and it would collapse every time .
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ ic@@ ature of an up@@ si@@ de-@@ down man .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fall@@ en into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
Well what he does is he moves around in a very dr@@ un@@ ken fashion on his head in a very un@@ predictable and extremely slow movement .
And it &apos;s kind of constr@@ ained by that circle .
Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to w@@ ander about in the space .
And there &apos;s no wires .
So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activ@@ ates this object .
And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it gains mom@@ en@@ tum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pull itself up .
So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechan@@ ics right and the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um and the dynam@@ ics .
And it was very important for us to establ@@ ish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would top@@ ple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that fat@@ alism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to lift itself up on its own .
So this is a work that we were very intrigu@@ ed with , working with the aes@@ thetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different si@@ zes of fiber op@@ tics , which tw@@ in@@ kle like the night sky .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
So we wr@@ apped this around a blo@@ b@@ -like form , which is in the shape of a te@@ d@@ dy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a te@@ d@@ dy bear , which is very com@@ for@@ ting and in@@ timate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ in@@ k@@ ling night sky .
So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space F@@ iller . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cube that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you approach@@ ed it , it tried to inti@@ mid@@ ate you by growing into a cube that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
And so this object is constantly expanding and contr@@ acting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to conce@@ al a secret within its se@@ ams or something .
So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
And once a creature po@@ ps into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
Thank you .

OK , so today I want to talk about how we talk about love .
And specifically , I want to talk about what &apos;s wrong with how we talk about love .
Most of us will probably fall in love a few times over the course of our lives , and in the English language , this metaphor , falling , is really the main way that we talk about that experience .
And I picture it this way because falling is not jum@@ ping .
F@@ all@@ ing is accident@@ al , it &apos;s un@@ controll@@ able .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without our con@@ sent .
And this — this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship .
I am a writer and I &apos;m also an English teacher , which means I think about words for a living .
You could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters , and I would like to argue that many of the met@@ ap@@ hors we use to talk about love — maybe even most of them — are a problem .
So , in love , we fall .
We &apos;re struck .
We are cr@@ ushed .
We sw@@ o@@ on .
We burn with passion .
Love makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
Our hearts ache , and then they break .
So our met@@ ap@@ hors equ@@ ate the experience of lo@@ ving someone to extreme violence or illness .
( Laughter ) They do .
And they position us as the victims of un@@ for@@ es@@ een and totally un@@ avo@@ id@@ able circumstances .
My favorite one of these is &quot; &quot; sm@@ it@@ ten , &quot; &quot; which is the past partici@@ ple of the word &quot; &quot; sm@@ ite . &quot; &quot; And if you look this word up in the dictionary — ( Laughter ) you will see that it can be defined as both &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ous aff@@ lic@@ tion , &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; to be very much in love . &quot; &quot; I tend to associ@@ ate the word &quot; &quot; sm@@ ite &quot; &quot; with a very particular context , which is the O@@ ld T@@ est@@ ament .
In the Bo@@ ok of Ex@@ od@@ us alone , there are 16 refer@@ ences to sm@@ iting , which is the word that the Bible uses for the ven@@ ge@@ ance of an angry God .
( Laughter ) Here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a pl@@ ague of loc@@ us@@ ts . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So , how did this happen ?
How have we come to associ@@ ate love with great pain and suffering ?
And why do we talk about this o@@ st@@ en@@ si@@ bly good experience as if we are victims ?
These are difficult questions , but I have some theories .
And to think this through , I want to focus on one metaphor in particular , which is the idea of love as ma@@ dness .
When I first started resear@@ ching roman@@ tic love , I found these ma@@ dness met@@ ap@@ hors everywhere .
These are just a few examples .
&quot; G@@ ot me looking , got me looking so crazy in love — &quot; ( Laughter ) from the great philos@@ opher , B@@ ey@@ oncé K@@ now@@ les . ( Laughter )
I fell in love for the first time when I was 20 , and it was a pretty tur@@ bul@@ ent relationship right from the start .
And it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high high@@ s and very low lows .
I can remember one moment in particular .
And it was late , it was nearly mid@@ night , we &apos;d gotten into an argument over dinner , and when we got back to our room , he threw his things in the bag and st@@ orm@@ ed out .
While I can no longer remember what that argument was about , I very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave .
I was 22 , it was my first time in the developing world , and I was totally alone .
I had another week until my flight home , and I knew the name of the town that I was in , and the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out , but I had no idea how to get around .
I had no gu@@ ide@@ book and very little money , and I spoke no Spanish .
Some@@ one more ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but I just fro@@ ze .
I just sat there .
And then I bur@@ st into tears .
But despite my pan@@ ic , some small voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was dramatic .
I must really be doing this love thing right . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to feel mis@@ erable in love .
And it sounds so strange to me now , but at 22 , I long@@ ed to have dramatic experiences , and in that moment , I was ir@@ rational and furi@@ ous and dev@@ ast@@ ated , and we@@ ir@@ dly enough , I thought that this somehow legi@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed the feelings I had for the guy who had just left me .
I think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because I thought that that was how loved worked .
This really should not be surprising , consi@@ dering that according to Wikipedia , there are eight films , 14 songs , two al@@ b@@ ums and one novel with the title &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ zy Love . &quot; &quot; About half an hour later , he came back to our room .
This must be a real rom@@ ance . &quot; &quot; I expected my first love to feel like ma@@ dness , and of course , it met that expect@@ ation very well .
But lo@@ ving someone like that — as if my entire well-being depend@@ ed on him lo@@ ving me back — was not very good for me or for him .
But I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
Most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of roman@@ tic love .
In fact , there is research to confir@@ m that this is somewhat normal , because , neuro@@ chem@@ ically speaking , roman@@ tic love and mental illness are not that easily distingu@@ ished .
This is true .
This study from 1999 used blood tests to confir@@ m that the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in levels of the new@@ ly in love very closely res@@ embl@@ ed the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in levels of people who had been diagnosed with obs@@ essi@@ ve-@@ comp@@ ul@@ sive disorder .
So there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our mo@@ ods and our behaviors .
And there are other studies to confir@@ m that most relationships begin this way .
Res@@ ear@@ chers believe that the low levels of ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in is cor@@ related with obs@@ essive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain .
And most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
But the good news is , it doesn &apos;t always last that long — usually from a few months to a couple of years .
When I got back from my trip to South America , I spent a lot of time alone in my room , chec@@ king my email , desper@@ ate to hear from the guy I loved .
I decided that if my friends could not understand my gri@@ ev@@ ous aff@@ lic@@ tion , then I did not need their friend@@ ship .
So I stopped hanging out with most of them .
And it was probably the most un@@ happy year of my life .
But I think I felt like it was my job to be mis@@ erable , because if I could be mis@@ erable , then I would prove how much I loved him .
And if I could prove it , then we would have to end up together eventually .
Our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
Our biology tells us that love is good by activ@@ ating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a break@@ up , that neuro@@ chemical reward is with@@ drawn .
And in fact — and maybe you &apos;ve heard this — neuro@@ chem@@ ically speaking , going through a break@@ up is a lot like going through coc@@ aine with@@ dra@@ w@@ al , which I find reas@@ sur@@ ing .
( Laughter ) And then our culture uses language to shape and rein@@ force these ideas about love .
In this case , we &apos;re talking about met@@ ap@@ hors about pain and ad@@ diction and ma@@ dness .
It &apos;s kind of an interesting feedback loop .
Love is powerful and at times painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful .
What &apos;s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values li@@ fel@@ ong mono@@ gam@@ y .
That sounds terrible .
( Laughter ) To re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this , we need to either change our culture or change our expectations .
So , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
If we were more ass@@ er@@ tive , more open-@@ min@@ ded , more generous and instead of falling in love , we ste@@ pped into love .
I know that this is asking a lot , but I &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest this .
They argue that met@@ ap@@ hors really do shape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a guide for future actions , like self-@@ ful@@ filling proph@@ ec@@ ies .
Johnson and L@@ ak@@ off suggest a new metaphor for love : love as a collaborative work of art .
I really like this way of thinking about love .
Lin@@ gu@@ ists talk about met@@ ap@@ hors as having ent@@ ail@@ ments , which is essentially a way of consi@@ dering all the implications of , or ideas cont@@ ained within , a given metaphor .
So if love is a collaborative work of art , then love is an aes@@ thetic experience .
Love is un@@ predictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustr@@ ating and emo@@ tionally demand@@ ing .
And love involves both joy and pain .
U@@ l@@ timately , each experience of love is different .
When I was younger , it never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love , that I didn &apos;t have to just accept whatever love offered .
When 14@@ -year-old Juli@@ et first me@@ ets — or , when 14@@ -year-old Juli@@ et cannot be with Rom@@ e@@ o , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel disap@@ pointed or ang@@ sty .
Where is she ?
She wants to die .
Right ?
And just as a ref@@ res@@ her , at this point in the play , act three of five , Rom@@ e@@ o is not dead .
He &apos;s alive , he &apos;s healthy , he &apos;s just been ban@@ ished from the city .
I understand that 16@@ th-@@ century Ver@@ ona is unlike contemporary North America , and yet when I first read this play , also at age 14 , Juli@@ et &apos;s suffering made sense to me .
Re@@ fr@@ aming love as something I get to create with someone I admi@@ re , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or con@@ sent , is empower@@ ing .
It &apos;s still hard .
Love still feels totally ma@@ dd@@ ening and cr@@ ush@@ ing some days , and when I feel really frustrated , I have to remind myself : my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what I want to make together .
This isn &apos;t easy , either .
But it &apos;s just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like ma@@ dness .
This version of love is not about winning or losing someone &apos;s aff@@ ection .
Instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when tru@@ sting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolu@@ tionary , radical act .
This is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you &apos;re g@@ aining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
This version of love allows us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good collabor@@ ators . Maybe this isn &apos;t for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; That relationship was shor@@ ter than I had plann@@ ed , but it was still kind of beautiful . &quot; &quot; The beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or s@@ cul@@ pt itself .
This version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m really glad to be here .
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all here .
And by &quot; &quot; here , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean here .
Or here .
On one side , all life on Earth needs energy .
And this seems like a tall order , especially if you want a suc@@ cul@@ ent tom@@ a@@ to .
This is what life needs to survive , all life .
So that leaves a few bodies that we should think about .
You want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid .
It &apos;s a Gol@@ dil@@ oc@@ k@@ s-@@ type problem , and it &apos;s so simple that a child could understand it .
Number one : if M@@ ama B@@ ear &apos;s bo@@ wl is too cold when Gol@@ dil@@ oc@@ ks walks into the room , does that mean it &apos;s always been too cold ?
Or could it have been just right at some other time ?
And the same is true with planets .
They v@@ ary . They evolve .
And of course , distance of a planet from the sun determin@@ es its temperature .
Earth has one ; Ven@@ us and Mars do not .
I like to think of it instead as a sal@@ ad bar s@@ nee@@ ze gu@@ ard for planets .
But we &apos;re working on it . How are we working on it ?
We have similar measu@@ rements from Ven@@ us and Earth .
You can &apos;t do that . You can &apos;t go there , not yet .
This is the only planet that we know of that &apos;s habit@@ able , although very soon we may come to know of more .
I &apos;m really glad we &apos;re here .
Thanks .
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
Think about everything it has brought us .
Think about all the services we use , all the connec@@ tivity , all the entertainment , all the business , all the commerce .
And it &apos;s happening during our life@@ times .
I &apos;m pretty sure that one day we &apos;ll be writing history books hundreds of years from now . This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online , the generation that built something really and truly global .
But yes , it &apos;s also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
I &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
So let me show you something .
This here is Br@@ ain .
This is a flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k — five and a quar@@ ter-@@ inch flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k infected by Br@@ ain@@ .A.
It &apos;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers .
And we actually know where Br@@ ain came from .
We know because it says so inside the code .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
That &apos;s the bo@@ ot sector of an infected flo@@ pp@@ y , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; &quot; W@@ el@@ come to the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on . &quot; &quot; And then it continues , saying , 198@@ 6 , Bas@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad .
And Bas@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad are first names , Pak@@ ist@@ ani first names .
In fact , there &apos;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) Now , 198@@ 6 .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
That &apos;s 25 years ago .
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now .
So half a year ago , I decided to go to Pakistan myself .
So let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .
This is from the city of La@@ hore , which is around 300 kilometers south from Ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where B@@ in Laden was caught .
Here &apos;s a typical street view .
And here &apos;s the street or road leading to this building , which is 7@@ 30 N@@ iz@@ am block at All@@ ama I@@ q@@ b@@ al T@@ own .
And I kno@@ cked on the door .
( Laughter ) You want to guess who opened the door ?
Bas@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad ; they are still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So here standing up is Bas@@ it .
S@@ itting down is his brother Am@@ j@@ ad .
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
Now of course , we had a very interesting discussion .
I asked them why .
I asked them how they feel about what they started .
And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Bas@@ it and Am@@ j@@ ad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely un@@ related other viruses over these years .
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
Now , the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .
So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .
What I &apos;m running here is a system that enables me to run ag@@ e-@@ old programs on a modern computer .
So let me just m@@ oun@@ t some drives . Go over there .
What we have here is a list of old viruses .
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .
For example , let &apos;s go with the C@@ enti@@ pe@@ de virus first .
And you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centi@@ pe@@ de s@@ cro@@ l@@ ling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
You know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
Here &apos;s another one . This is the virus called Cr@@ ash , invented in Russia in 199@@ 2 .
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound .
( Si@@ ren noise ) And the last example , guess what the Wal@@ ker virus does ?
Yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
So it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by h@@ ob@@ by@@ ists and teenagers .
Today , they are no longer being written by h@@ ob@@ by@@ ists and teenagers .
Today , viruses are a global problem .
What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs , where we track virus infections worldwide .
So we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just bloc@@ ked viruses in Sweden and T@@ ai@@ w@@ an and Russia and elsewhere .
In fact , if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web , we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses , how many new examples of mal@@ ware we find every single day .
Here &apos;s the latest virus we &apos;ve found , in a file called Ser@@ ver@@ .@@ ex@@ e.
And we found it right over here three seconds ago — the previous one , six seconds ago .
And if we just s@@ cro@@ ll around , it &apos;s just massive .
We find tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands .
And that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ ware every single day .
So where are all these coming from then ?
Well today , it &apos;s the organized criminal gang@@ s writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .
It &apos;s gang@@ s like — let &apos;s go to G@@ ang@@ st@@ a@@ B@@ uck@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
This is a website operating in M@@ os@@ cow where these guys are buying infected computers .
So if you are a virus writer and you &apos;re capable of inf@@ ecting Win@@ dows computers , but you don &apos;t know what to do with them , you can sell those infected computers — somebody else &apos;s computers — to these guys .
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
So how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those infected computers ?
Well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will steal money from your online ban@@ king accoun@@ ts when you do online ban@@ king , or key@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers .
K@@ ey@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers sil@@ ently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
So you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing Google sear@@ ches .
Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
S@@ ame thing with every single pass@@ word and so on .
But the thing that they &apos;re actually looking for most are s@@ essions where you go online and do online pur@@ ch@@ ases in any online store .
Because when you do pur@@ ch@@ ases in online stores , you will be ty@@ ping in your name , the delivery address , your credit card number and the credit card security codes .
And here &apos;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .
That &apos;s the credit card number , that &apos;s the ex@@ pir@@ ation date , that &apos;s the security code , and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
Once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
And that , obviously , is a problem .
We now have a whole underground market@@ place and business ecosystem built around online crime .
One example of how these guys actually are capable of mon@@ e@@ tiz@@ ing their operations : we go and have a look at the pages of I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L and search for wanted pers@@ ons .
We find guys like B@@ j@@ or@@ n Sun@@ d@@ in , originally from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also lis@@ ted on the I@@ N@@ TE@@ R@@ P@@ O@@ L wanted pages , Mr. Sh@@ ail@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ u@@ mar J@@ ain , a U.S. citizen .
These guys were running an operation called I.@@ M@@ .@@ U@@ . , a cyber@@ crime operation through which they net@@ ted millions .
They are both right now on the run .
Nobody knows where they are .
U.S. offici@@ als , just a couple of weeks ago , fro@@ ze a S@@ wis@@ s bank account bel@@ ong@@ ing to Mr. J@@ ain , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it .
So the amount of money online crime gener@@ ates is significant .
And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .
We know that online criminals are hi@@ ring programm@@ ers , hi@@ ring testing people , testing their code , having back@@ -@@ end systems with S@@ Q@@ L datab@@ ases .
And they can afford to watch how we work — like how security people work — and try to work their way around any security pre@@ cau@@ tions we can build .
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .
I mean , the Internet is international .
That &apos;s why we call it the Internet .
And if you just go and take a look at what &apos;s happening in the online world , here &apos;s a video built by Cl@@ ari@@ fied Net@@ works , which illustr@@ ates how one single mal@@ ware family is able to move around the world .
This operation , believed to be originally from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia , moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .
So you just can &apos;t shut these guys down .
They will switch from one country to another , from one jur@@ is@@ diction to another — moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tic@@ kets to all the online criminals of the world .
Now , criminals who weren &apos;t capable of reaching us before can reach us .
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?
How do you actually track them down ?
Let me give you an example .
What we have here is one exploit file .
Here , I &apos;m looking at the He@@ x dum@@ p of an image file , which contains an exploit .
And that basically means , if you &apos;re trying to view this image file on your Win@@ dows computer , it actually takes over your computer and runs code .
Now , if you &apos;ll take a look at this image file — well there &apos;s the image hea@@ der , and there the actual code of the attack starts .
And that code has been en@@ cryp@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ ry@@ pt it .
It has been en@@ cryp@@ ted with X@@ O@@ R function 97 .
You just have to believe me , it is , it is .
And we can go here and actually start dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ting it .
Well the yellow part of the code is now dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ted .
And I know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
But just keep star@@ ing at it .
You &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address : uni@@ on@@ see@@ k@@ .com / d / i@@ oo@@ .@@ ex@@ e And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
And that &apos;s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
But even more interestingly , if we continue dec@@ ry@@ p@@ ting , we &apos;ll find this myster@@ ious string , which says O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ US .
That code is there underneath the en@@ cry@@ ption as some sort of a signature .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
And I was looking at that , trying to figure out what it means .
So obviously I Goo@@ gl@@ ed for it .
I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
So I spoke with the guys at the lab .
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in R@@ US like Russia .
And 7@@ 8 is the city code for the city of St@@ . P@@ eter@@ sbur@@ g .
For example , you can find it from some phone numbers and car license pl@@ ates and stuff like that .
So I went looking for contacts in St@@ . P@@ eter@@ sbur@@ g , and through a long road , we eventually found this one particular website .
Here &apos;s this Russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular Li@@ ve Journ@@ al .
And on this blog , he blogs about his life , about his life in St@@ . P@@ eter@@ sbur@@ g — he &apos;s in his early 20@@ s — about his cat , about his gir@@ l@@ friend .
And he drives a very nice car .
In fact , this guy drives a Mer@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ Ben@@ z S@@ 600 V@@ 12 with a six@@ -@@ lit@@ er engine with more than 400 hor@@ se@@ power .
Now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20@@ -@@ something year-old kid in St@@ . P@@ eter@@ sbur@@ g .
How do I know about this car ?
Because he blo@@ gged about the car .
He actually had a car accident .
In down@@ town St@@ . P@@ eter@@ sbur@@ g , he actually crash@@ ed his car into another car .
And he put blo@@ gged images about the car accident — that &apos;s his Mer@@ ce@@ des — right here is the L@@ ada Sam@@ ar@@ a he crash@@ ed into .
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Sam@@ ar@@ a ends in 7@@ 8@@ R@@ US .
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the Mer@@ ce@@ des is O@@ 6@@ 00@@ K@@ O@@ 7@@ 8@@ R@@ US .
Now I &apos;m not a lawyer , but if I would be , this is where I would say , &quot; &quot; I rest my case . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what happens when online criminals are caught ?
Well in most cases it never gets this far .
The vast majority of the online crime cases , we don &apos;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from .
And even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
The local police don &apos;t act , or if they do , there &apos;s not enough evidence , or for some reason we can &apos;t take them down .
I wish it would be easier ; unfortunately it isn &apos;t .
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .
You &apos;ve all heard about things like Stu@@ x@@ net .
So if you look at what Stu@@ x@@ net did is that it infected these .
That &apos;s a Si@@ em@@ ens S@@ 7@@ -@@ 400 P@@ L@@ C , programm@@ able logic &#91; controll@@ er &#93; .
And this is what runs our infrastructure .
This is what runs everything around us .
P@@ L@@ C &apos;s , these small boxes which have no display , no keyboard , which are programm@@ ed , are put in place , and they do their job .
For example , the elev@@ ators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .
And when Stu@@ x@@ net inf@@ ects one of these , that &apos;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .
Because everything around us is being run by these .
I mean , we have critical infrastructure .
You go to any factory , any power plant , any chemical plant , any food processing plant , you look around — everything is being run by computers .
Everything is being run by computers .
Everything is reli@@ ant on these computers working .
We have become very reli@@ ant on Internet , on basic things like electricity , obviously , on computers working .
And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .
We must have some way of continu@@ ing to work even if computers fail .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So prepar@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
It &apos;s actually very basic stuff — thinking about continu@@ ity , thinking about back@@ ups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
Now I told you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I do .
Think about all the services we have online .
Think about if they are taken away from you , if one day you don &apos;t actually have them for some reason or another .
I see beauty in the future of the Internet , but I &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
I &apos;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .
On@@ line crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve spent my life def@@ ending the N@@ et , and I do feel that if we don &apos;t fight online crime , we are running a risk of losing it all .
We have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
What we need is more global , international law en@@ forcement work to find online criminal gang@@ s — these organized gang@@ s that are making millions out of their attacks .
That &apos;s much more important than running anti-@@ viruses or running fire@@ walls .
What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks , and even more importantly , we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime , but haven &apos;t yet done it .
We have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 20@@ 25 , these Gol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s proj@@ ected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by B@@ N@@ P Par@@ i@@ bas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
Gol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s proj@@ ected 20@@ 27 .
The post-@@ crisis projection is 2020 .
That &apos;s just a decade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental resp@@ ects .
First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.@@ 3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
Second@@ ly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world — which I think is what China will become — will be not from the West and from very , very different civil@@ iz@@ ational roots .
Now , I know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad assum@@ ption in the West that as countries mo@@ derni@@ ze , they also w@@ ester@@ ni@@ ze .
This is an illusion .
It &apos;s an assum@@ ption that modern@@ ity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
It will remain in very fundamental resp@@ ects very different .
Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
How do we try to understand what China is ?
And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
We can &apos;t .
Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
The first is this : that China is not really a nation@@ -@@ state .
Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation@@ -@@ state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
This was what China looked like with the vic@@ t@@ ory of the Q@@ in D@@ yn@@ as@@ ty in 2@@ 21 B@@ .C. at the end of the w@@ arr@@ ing-@@ state period — the birth of modern China .
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
Or immediately after@@ ward , the H@@ an D@@ yn@@ as@@ ty , still 2,000 years ago .
And you can see already it occu@@ pies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation@@ -@@ state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of cu@@ st@@ oms like anc@@ es@@ tr@@ al wor@@ ship , of a very distinc@@ tive notion of the state , li@@ ke@@ wise , a very distinc@@ tive notion of the family , social relationships like gu@@ anx@@ i , Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an values and so on .
These are all things that come from the period of the civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than as a nation@@ -@@ state .
And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , dem@@ ograph@@ ically and ge@@ ograph@@ ically , with a population of 1.@@ 3 billion people .
What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pl@@ ur@@ alistic , and in many ways very dec@@ entr@@ alized .
You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
It &apos;s never been the case .
So this is China , a civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , rather than a nation@@ -@@ state .
And what does it mean ?
Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is un@@ ity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : break@@ down — the frag@@ mentation of the Ho@@ ly Rom@@ an Em@@ pire .
It divided , and it &apos;s remain@@ ed divided ever since .
China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very pain@@ fully holding this huge civilization , civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , together .
The second is maybe more pro@@ sai@@ c , which is Hong Kong .
Do you remember the han@@ do@@ ver of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
You may remember what the Chinese constitu@@ tional proposition was .
One country , two systems .
And I &apos;ll lay a w@@ ager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
&quot; &quot; Win@@ do@@ w dr@@ essing .
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot; &quot; Th@@ ir@@ te@@ en years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation@@ -@@ state ways .
Think of German uni@@ fication , 1990 .
What happened ?
Well , basically the East was s@@ wal@@ lowed by the West .
One nation , one system .
That is the nation@@ -@@ state ment@@ ality .
But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong — as it will be to the question of T@@ ai@@ w@@ an — was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China — maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
Do you know , of the 1.@@ 3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they bel@@ ong to the same race , the H@@ an ?
Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most popul@@ ous countries .
India , the United States , Indon@@ esia , Brazil — all of them are multi@@ rac@@ ial .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multi@@ rac@@ ial really at the mar@@ g@@ ins .
So the question is , why ?
Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conqu@@ est , occup@@ ation , absor@@ ption , as@@ simil@@ ation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the H@@ an emerged — of course , nur@@ tured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the H@@ an , China could never have held together .
The H@@ an identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
The great dis@@ advantage of it is that the H@@ an have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
They really believe in their own super@@ i@@ ority , and they are dis@@ respect@@ ful of those who are not .
H@@ ence their attitude , for example , to the U@@ y@@ gh@@ u@@ rs and to the Ti@@ bet@@ ans .
Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
Now we in the West overwhel@@ min@@ gly seem to think — in these days at least — that the authority and legi@@ tim@@ acy of the state is a function of democracy .
The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjo@@ ys more legi@@ tim@@ acy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
And the reason for this is because — well , there are two reasons , I think .
And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
And the reason for this is , fir@@ stly , because the state in China is given a very special — it enjo@@ ys a very special signific@@ ance as the represent@@ ative , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the gu@@ ardi@@ an of Chinese civilization , of the civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state .
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continu@@ ously challeng@@ ed — I mean in the European tradition , histor@@ ically against the church , against other sec@@ tors of the ar@@ is@@ to@@ cracy , against mer@@ chants and so on — for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challeng@@ ed .
It &apos;s had no serious riv@@ als .
So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
Wh@@ ereas we tend to view it as an in@@ tru@@ der , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constr@@ ained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
The Chinese view the state as an in@@ timate — not just as an in@@ timate actually , as a member of the family — not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patri@@ ar@@ ch of the family .
This is the Chinese view of the state — very , very different to ours .
It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
K@@ now that China believ@@ es in the market and the state .
I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18@@ th century , said , &quot; &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot; &quot; And , apart from the Ma@@ o period , that has remain@@ ed more or less the case ever since .
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
The state is everywhere in China .
I mean , it &apos;s leading fir@@ ms — many of them are still public@@ ly owned .
Pri@@ v@@ ate fir@@ ms , however large they are , like L@@ en@@ ov@@ o , depend in many ways on state patr@@ on@@ age .
T@@ ar@@ gets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas — as we are familiar with — with something like the one-@@ child policy .
Mo@@ re@@ over , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of stat@@ ecraft .
I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
But this is another , this is the Grand Can@@ al , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B@@ .C.
and was finally complet@@ ed in the sev@@ ent@@ h century A@@ .D.
It went for 1,@@ 1@@ 14 miles , lin@@ king Beijing with H@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou and Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastruc@@ tural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three G@@ org@@ es D@@ am and many other expressions of state comp@@ et@@ ence within China .
So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China — the civil@@ iz@@ ation@@ -@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
And yet we still ins@@ ist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
If you want to know why we un@@ er@@ r@@ ingly seem to get China wrong — our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are in@@ correct — this is the reason .
Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little W@@ es@@ tern@@ er ment@@ ality .
It &apos;s kind of arro@@ g@@ ant .
It &apos;s arro@@ g@@ ant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
And secon@@ dly , it &apos;s ignor@@ ant .
We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Co@@ hen , the American histori@@ an .
And Paul Co@@ hen ar@@ gues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmo@@ polit@@ an of all cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many ways , it &apos;s the most paro@@ chi@@ al , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civil@@ iz@@ ations .
Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
Wh@@ ereas those cultures — virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far wea@@ ker position , vis@@ -@@ a-@@ vis the West — have been there@@ by forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmo@@ polit@@ an in many ways than the West .
I mean , take the question of East Asia .
East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . — a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
Now the largest economic region in the world .
And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East A@@ si@@ an@@ ers , people from East Asia , are far more knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the West than the West is about East Asia .
Now this point is very ger@@ man@@ e , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Gol@@ d@@ man S@@ ach@@ s chart .
What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G@@ 20 u@@ sur@@ ping very rapidly the position of the G@@ 7 , or the G@@ 8 .
And there are two consequences of this .
First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago — Copenh@@ agen , climate change conference .
Europe was not at the final negoti@@ ating table .
When did that last happen ?
I would w@@ ager it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
And the second implication is that the world will inev@@ it@@ ably , as a consequence , become increasingly un@@ familiar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and hist@@ ories that we are not really familiar with , or convers@@ ant with .
And at last , I &apos;m afraid — take Europe ; America is slightly different — but Europe@@ ans by and large , I have to say , are ignor@@ ant , are un@@ aware about the way the world is changing .
Some people — I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; &quot; The continent is sle@@ ep@@ walking into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on . &quot; &quot; Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exag@@ ger@@ ation .
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this — that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world — and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
I mean , Europe once , of course , once command@@ ed the future in its confidence .
Take the 19th century , for example .
But this , al@@ as , is no longer true .
If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China — there &apos;s old Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us .
This is a rail@@ way station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a rail@@ way station .
This is the new &#91; W@@ u@@ h@@ an &#93; rail@@ way station for the high-@@ speed trains .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shor@@ tly in a sub@@ ur@@ b of Beijing .
Here you have a meg@@ ab@@ us , on the upper dec@@ k car@@ ries about 2,000 people .
It trav@@ els on rai@@ ls down a sub@@ urban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
And it does spe@@ eds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
But I want to argue , above all , a bi@@ g@@ -@@ picture positive for this world .
For 200 years , the world was essentially govern@@ ed by a frag@@ ment of the human population .
That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
The arriv@@ al of countries like China and India — between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population — and others like Indon@@ esia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of demo@@ crati@@ zation in the last 200 years .
C@@ iv@@ il@@ iz@@ ations and cultures , which had been igno@@ red , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
As human@@ ists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civil@@ iz@@ ations .
This big ship here was the one s@@ ailed in by Z@@ hen@@ g He in the early 15@@ th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christ@@ opher Colum@@ bus cross@@ ed the Atlantic .
( Laughter ) Or , look carefully at this silk s@@ cro@@ ll made by Z@@ hu@@ Z@@ h@@ ou in 13@@ 6@@ 8 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Chris@@ t , the Chinese even invented golf .
W@@ el@@ come to the future . Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
Now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
By revolution , I mean a dr@@ as@@ tic and far@@ -@@ reaching change in the way we think and behave — the way we think and the way we behave .
Now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
We need a revolution because things aren &apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
And that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
You know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
And we are last place in so many things — for example , social factors .
We &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
There we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
We &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
And there we are , not just last in the E.@@ U@@ . , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
And worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Econom@@ ist .
We &apos;re the s@@ add@@ est place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita — the s@@ add@@ est place on Earth .
That &apos;s social . Let &apos;s look at education .
Where do we r@@ ank three weeks ago in another report by the O@@ E@@ CD ?
Last in reading , math and science . Last .
Bus@@ iness : The low@@ est perception in the E.@@ U@@ .
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
Why as a result , what happens ?
The low@@ est percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
We hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
So if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
Last in Europe GDP per capita .
Last .
So it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 6@@ 2 percent of B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ians are not optimistic about the future .
We &apos;re un@@ happy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
And these are facts , guys .
This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe .
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a con@@ spir@@ acy I have got against B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia . These are facts .
So I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
The way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of be@@ having is broken .
We need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and behave to transform B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
How did this happen ?
Let &apos;s be positive now . We &apos;re going to get positive . How did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because — and this is going to be dr@@ as@@ tic to some of you — because we are handic@@ apping ourselves .
We &apos;re holding ourselves back because we don &apos;t value play .
I said &quot; &quot; play , &quot; &quot; all right .
In case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like .
Bab@@ ies play , kids play , adults play .
We don &apos;t value play .
In fact , we dev@@ al@@ ue play .
And we dev@@ al@@ ue it in three areas .
Let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
Social : 45 years of what ?
Of commun@@ ism — of valu@@ ing the society and the state over the individual and squ@@ ash@@ ing , in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently , creativity , individual self-@@ expression and innovation .
And instead , what do we value ?
Because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?
To be serious .
To be really , really serious .
It did .
( Applause ) Be serious .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been scol@@ ded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
He@@ av@@ en for@@ bi@@ d they play in the dir@@ t , the k@@ al , or even worse , lo@@ k@@ v@@ i , water — that will kill them .
I have been told by bab@@ as and dy@@ ado@@ s that we shouldn &apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seri@@ ousness of life .
We have a serious mem@@ e running through .
It &apos;s a social gene running through us .
It &apos;s a serious gene .
It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the &quot; &quot; bab@@ a factor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And here &apos;s how it works .
Ste@@ p one : woman says , &quot; &quot; I want to have a baby . I@@ sk@@ am baby . &quot; &quot; Ste@@ p two : we get the baby . Woo@@ ho@@ o !
But then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coff@@ ees .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ ko to bab@@ a .
But we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been infected by the serious mem@@ e for 45 years .
So what happens ?
She passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time — as the red@@ wood trees — for that serious mem@@ e to get out of our operating system .
What happens then ?
It goes into education where we have an anti@@ qu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values r@@ ote learning , memor@@ ization and stand@@ ardi@@ zation , and dev@@ al@@ ues self-@@ expression , self-@@ exploration , ques@@ tioning , creativity and play .
It &apos;s a cr@@ ap system .
Tr@@ ue story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
We went to this pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
And we said , &quot; &quot; Well what about play and rec@@ ess ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; H@@ a . There won &apos;t be a single moment in the s@@ che@@ du@@ le . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s five . &quot; &quot; What a crime . What a crime .
And it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating mind@@ less , robotic workers to put b@@ ol@@ ts in pre-@@ dr@@ illed holes .
But I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Indus@@ trial Revolution .
We need adap@@ tability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
We don &apos;t need mechan@@ ized workers .
But no , now our mem@@ e goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
What are qualities of a B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ian work ?
Au@@ to@@ cratic — do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
Un@@ tru@@ sting — you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to inst@@ all cameras .
( Laughter ) Con@@ tr@@ oll@@ ing — you &apos;re obviously an idiot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ il@@ lion little processes for you to follow so you don &apos;t step out of the box .
So they &apos;re restric@@ tive — don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the Internet , don &apos;t be on I.@@ M.
That &apos;s somehow un@@ professional and bad .
And at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ ful@@ filling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restric@@ ted , you &apos;re not valu@@ ed and you &apos;re not having any fun .
In social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we don &apos;t value play .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . What a dum@@ b idea .
It can &apos;t be because of play .
Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot; &quot; We have the serious mem@@ e in us .
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech — that play is the cataly@@ st , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better .
Pl@@ ay : our brains are hard@@ wired for play .
E@@ volution has sel@@ ected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
And you know what ?
E@@ volution does a really , really good job of des@@ elec@@ ting traits that aren &apos;t adv@@ ant@@ age@@ ous to us and sel@@ ecting traits for competitive advantage .
Nature isn &apos;t stupid , and it sel@@ ected for play .
Th@@ rough@@ out the animal k@@ ingdom , for example : ants . An@@ ts play .
Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
But when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynam@@ ics of things .
R@@ ats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
K@@ it@@ tens play . We all know k@@ it@@ tens play .
But what you may not know is that k@@ it@@ tens de@@ priv@@ ed of play are unable to interact soci@@ ally .
They can still hun@@ t , but they can &apos;t be social .
B@@ ears play .
But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
It &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
And a final really interesting study — it &apos;s been shown , a cor@@ relation between play and brain size .
The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
D@@ ol@@ phins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
Y@@ ours truly : humans .
K@@ ids play , we play — of every nation@@ ality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
It &apos;s a universal thing — we play .
And it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
Really cool term : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y — the re@@ tention of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile traits in adults .
And who are the biggest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
Hum@@ ans . We play sports .
We do it for fun , or as Olym@@ pi@@ ans , or as profession@@ als .
We play musical instruments .
We dance , we k@@ iss , we sing , we just go@@ of around .
We &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
We &apos;re designed to do that continu@@ ously — to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
It is a huge benefit .
Just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
For example , it &apos;s been shown to stimul@@ ate neural growth in the am@@ yg@@ d@@ ala , in the area where it controls emotions .
It &apos;s been shown to promote pre-@@ frontal cortex development where a lot of cogni@@ tion is happening .
As a result , what happens ?
We develop more emotional mat@@ urity if we play more .
We develop better dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making ability if we play more .
These guys are facts .
It &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
These are the benefits to play .
It is a genetic birth@@ right that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
And if we handic@@ ap ourselves with play , we handic@@ ap ourselves as if we would with any other birth@@ right that we have .
We hold ourselves back .
Little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
Imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without so@@ c@@ cer , without football , without l@@ aughter .
What does this world look like ?
It &apos;s pretty bl@@ ea@@ k .
It &apos;s pretty glu@@ m .
Now imagine your work@@ place .
Is it fun ? Is it play@@ ful ?
Or maybe the work@@ place of your friends — here we &apos;re forward thinking .
Is it fun ? Is it play@@ ful ?
Or is it cr@@ ap ? Is it auto@@ cratic , controlling , restric@@ tive and un@@ tru@@ sting and un@@ ful@@ filling ?
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
We even feel guil@@ ty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
&quot; Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
He &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &quot; &quot; But I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
The opposite of play is not work . The opposite of play
is depression . It &apos;s depression .
In fact , play impro@@ ves our work .
Just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
For example , it stimul@@ ates creativity .
It increases our openness to change .
It impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
It provides a sense of purpose and mas@@ tery — two key motiv@@ ational things that increase productivity , through play .
So before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play doesn &apos;t mean fri@@ vol@@ ous .
You know , the professional ath@@ le@@ te that lo@@ ves ski@@ ing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he lo@@ ves it .
He &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the gro@@ o@@ ve , he &apos;s in the flow .
A doctor might be serious , but l@@ aughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
Our thinking is backwards .
We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guil@@ ty .
We should be celebr@@ ating play .
Qu@@ ick example from the corporate world .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x , easy mot@@ to : people , service , profit .
If you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happ@@ ier , they &apos;re ful@@ filled , they have a sense of mas@@ tery and purpose .
What happens ? They give better service — not worse , but better .
And when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are ful@@ filled , how do the customers feel ? They feel great .
And what do great customers do , gre@@ at-@@ feeling customers ?
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
People , service , profit .
Pl@@ ay increases productivity , not dec@@ reas@@ es .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Ge@@ e , that can work for F@@ ed@@ E@@ x out there in the United States , but it can &apos;t work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia .
No way . We &apos;re different . &quot; &quot; It does work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia , you guys . Two reasons .
One , play is universal .
There &apos;s nothing weird about B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ians that we can &apos;t play , besides the serious mem@@ e that we have to kick out .
Two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sci@@ ant .
When I got there , we had zero happy customers .
Not one custom@@ er would ref@@ er us .
I asked them all .
We had margin@@ al profit — I did .
We had margin@@ al profits , and we had un@@ happy st@@ a@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders .
Th@@ rough some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like prom@@ oting self-@@ direction and collaboration , encour@@ aging collaboration , not auto@@ cracy , the things like having a resul@@ ts-@@ focus .
I don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I don &apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your custom@@ er and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
Why do I care if you get in at nine o &apos;@@ clock ?
Basically prom@@ oting fun .
Th@@ rough prom@@ oting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sci@@ ant and , in just three short years — sounds like a long time , but change is slow — every custom@@ er , from zero to every custom@@ er refer@@ ring us , above average profits for the industry and happy st@@ a@@ ke@@ hol@@ ders .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &quot; &quot; Well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the ran@@ kings for best employer for small business .
In@@ dependent analysis from anony@@ mous employees on their surve@@ ys .
It does , and it can , work in B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia .
There &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own ment@@ ality about play .
So some steps that we can take — to finish up — how to make this revolution through play .
First of all , you have to believe me .
If you don &apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
Second of all , if you don &apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to re@@ discover play .
Wh@@ at@@ ever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjo@@ yed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that prom@@ otion you can &apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , re@@ discover it .
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain bi@@ king or reading a book or playing a game .
Re@@ discover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
You &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ign@@ ite the fire of change in the play revolution .
You guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
You &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &quot; &quot; We@@ ird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to em@@ power you , and I &apos;m going to del@@ eg@@ ate to the low@@ est level , rather than the top .
I &apos;m going to encourage construc@@ tive cri@@ tic@@ ism .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
Because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the r@@ ut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
We &apos;re not always right as leaders .
We &apos;re going to eradic@@ ate fear .
F@@ ear is the enemy of play .
And we &apos;re going to do things like elim@@ inate restric@@ tions .
You know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls — heaven for@@ bi@@ d .
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on instant mess@@ eng@@ ers .
Let them take long lun@@ ches .
L@@ unch is like the rec@@ ess for work .
It &apos;s when you go out in the world and you re@@ charge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some sy@@ ner@@ gy of ideas that maybe you wouldn &apos;t have had before .
Let them do it . Give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . Let them have fun at the work@@ place .
We spend so much of our lives at the work@@ place , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a mis@@ erable gr@@ ind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , &quot; &quot; Is this it ?
Is that all there was ? &quot; &quot; Un@@ acceptable . Ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
( Laughter ) So in summar@@ y , we need a dr@@ as@@ tic change in the way we think and behave , but we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
What we need is a players &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing . What we need is a players &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing . What we need is a players &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing .
Ser@@ i@@ ously , we need to band together . Today is the start of the u@@ pris@@ ing . But what you need to do is fan the flam@@ es of the revolution . You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories
of what worked about rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play prom@@ otes a sense of promise and self-@@ ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment ; of how play prom@@ otes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
Because we can &apos;t do it alone . We have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform B@@ ul@@ gar@@ ia for the better .
Thank you .

So I want to start by off@@ ering you a free no@@ -@@ tech life h@@ ack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes .
But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little au@@ dit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves smaller ?
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an aw@@ k@@ ward interaction , or a smile , or a con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very aw@@ k@@ ward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a hand@@ shake .
Narrator : Here they are arri@@ ving at Number 10 .
So obviously when we think about non@@ verb@@ al behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ verb@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
And we make s@@ wee@@ ping jud@@ g@@ ments and in@@ fer@@ ences from body language .
And those jud@@ g@@ ments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
We are also influ@@ enced by our non@@ verb@@ als , our thoughts and our feelings and our physi@@ ology .
So what non@@ verb@@ als am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psycho@@ logist . I study pre@@ judi@@ ce , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynam@@ ics .
I became especially interested in non@@ verb@@ al expressions of power and domin@@ ance .
And what are non@@ verb@@ al expressions of power and domin@@ ance ?
So in the animal k@@ ingdom , they are about expanding .
So you make yourself big , you stret@@ ch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
It &apos;s about opening up .
We make ourselves small .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
You have other people who are virtually collap@@ sing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
I notice a couple of things about this .
Women feel chron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A classroom , because participation coun@@ ts for half the grade .
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re particip@@ ating .
So it goes both ways .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the power@@ less look like ?
So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more ass@@ er@@ tive and more confident , more optimistic .
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
So do you want the high-@@ power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one , but really stress re@@ active ?
So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minim@@ al level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
Here are a couple more .
And here are the low-@@ power poses .
So you &apos;re fol@@ ding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
So this is what happens .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
Here &apos;s what we find on tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one .
So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ sol .
So it seems that our non@@ verb@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
And so we think where you want to use this is evalu@@ ative situations , like social threat situations .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
Imagine this is the person intervie@@ wing you .
So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led .
People hate this .
We then have these co@@ ders look at these tap@@ es , four of them .
They &apos;re blind to the hypo@@ thesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
These kinds of things .
So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or medi@@ ating the effect .
So I said , fake it till you make it .
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a frau@@ d .
When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
I was thrown from the car .
I knew my I@@ Q because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gi@@ f@@ ted as a child .
So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y tw@@ ea@@ ks can lead to big changes .
So , this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
That &apos;s what you want to do .
Get your tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one up . Get your cor@@ ti@@ sol down .
Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
Thank you .
Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
Dis@@ cus@@ s . Great creativity is aston@@ ish@@ ingly , absur@@ dly , r@@ ation@@ ally , ir@@ r@@ ation@@ ally powerful .
Great creativity can spread toler@@ ance , champi@@ on freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
( Laughter ) Great creativity can turn a spo@@ t@@ light on de@@ priv@@ ation , or show that de@@ priv@@ ation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
Great creativity can make politicians el@@ ect@@ able , or parties un@@ el@@ ect@@ able .
It can make war seem like tragedy or far@@ ce .
Cre@@ ativity is the mem@@ e-@@ maker that puts slog@@ ans on our t-@@ shir@@ ts and phrases on our li@@ ps .
It &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that shows us a simple road through an im@@ pen@@ etr@@ able moral ma@@ ze .
Science is clever , but great creativity is something less know@@ able , more magical . And now we need that magic .
This is a time of need .
Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provo@@ ke us to think differently with dramatic creative stat@@ ements .
To temp@@ t us to act differently with deli@@ ght@@ ful creative scr@@ aps .
Here is one such scr@@ ap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be green@@ er .
( Video ) Man : You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
Str@@ ange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
A de@@ er with an itch@@ y leg . A flying motor@@ cycle .
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a myster@@ ious wall .
And then he stopped . Wal@@ king in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had ski@@ pped with him through fields and broken his heart .
S@@ ure , she had aged a little .
In fact , she had aged a lot .
But he felt all his old passion for her return .
&quot; &quot; Ford , &quot; &quot; he called sof@@ tly . For that was her name .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gu@@ sty , &quot; &quot; she said , for that was his name .
&quot; &quot; I know a tent next to a car@@ av@@ an , exactly 300 y@@ ards from here .
Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot; &quot; Ford un@@ dressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
Gu@@ sty entered her b@@ ol@@ dly and made love to her rhyth@@ m@@ ically while she fil@@ med him , because she was a ke@@ en am@@ ateur por@@ no@@ grap@@ her .
The earth moved for both of them .
And they lived together happ@@ ily ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
( Applause ) An@@ dy H@@ obs@@ b@@ aw@@ m : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
The moral im@@ per@@ ative is on the table .
Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and shar@@ p .
To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
So this is a call , a ple@@ a , to the incredibly tal@@ ented TED community .
Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .
( Applause )
B@@ eau L@@ ot@@ to : So , this game is very simple .
All you have to do is read what you see . Right ?
So , I &apos;m going to count to you , so we don &apos;t all do it together .
Okay , one , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Audience : Can you read this ?
B@@ L : Ama@@ zing . What about this one ? One , two , thre@@ e@@ .@@ Audience : You are not reading this .
B@@ L : All right . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) If you were Portu@@ gu@@ ese , right ? How about this one ? One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
B@@ L : What are you reading ? There are no words there .
I said , read what you &apos;re seeing . Right ?
It literally says , &quot; &quot; W@@ at ar ou re@@ a in ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Right ?
That &apos;s what you should have said . Right ? Why is this ?
It &apos;s because perception is gr@@ ounded in our experience .
Right ? The brain takes meaning@@ less information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what &apos;s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
All right ? Which means , when it comes to perception , we &apos;re all like this fro@@ g .
( Laughter ) Right ? It &apos;s getting information . It &apos;s gener@@ ating behavior that &apos;s useful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : O@@ w ! O@@ w ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) B@@ L : And sometimes , when things don &apos;t go our way , we get a little bit an@@ no@@ yed , right ?
But we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
And perception under@@ p@@ ins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hop@@ es , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
Now if perception is gr@@ ounded in our history , it means we &apos;re only ever respon@@ ding according to what we &apos;ve done before .
But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
Now , I want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
They begin with a question .
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
Now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . It &apos;s evolu@@ tion@@ arily a bad thing . If you &apos;re not sure that &apos;s a predat@@ or , it &apos;s too late .
Okay ? ( Laughter ) Even seas@@ ick@@ ness is a consequence of uncertainty .
Right ? If you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . Your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in reg@@ ister with the boat , say I &apos;m standing still .
Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
And yet , the ir@@ ony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
So how can we ever do anything new ? Well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right ?
And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
They &apos;re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . Right ?
It &apos;s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what ext@@ ends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really ste@@ pping into that space .
So what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
It &apos;s play .
Now play is not simply a process . Ex@@ per@@ ts in play will tell you that actually it &apos;s a way of being .
Pl@@ ay is one of the only human end@@ e@@ av@@ ors where uncertainty is actually celebr@@ ated . Un@@ certainty is what makes play fun .
Right ? It &apos;s adap@@ table to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and it &apos;s co@@ oper@@ ative . It &apos;s actually how we do our social bon@@ ding , and it &apos;s intrins@@ ically motiv@@ ated . What that means is that we play to play . Pl@@ ay is its own reward .
Now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
It &apos;s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
So if you add rules to play , you have a game .
That &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
So armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
And who better to ask than 25 ei@@ ght@@ - to 10@@ -year-old children ?
Because they &apos;re experts in play . So I took my bee ar@@ ena down to a small school in Dev@@ on , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . Right ?
The first step was to ask a question .
Now , I should say that we didn &apos;t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn &apos;t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids couldn &apos;t do it .
So we did it anyway . Right ? Of course .
So , here are some of the questions . I put them in small print so you wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther reading it . Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years . Right ?
So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
Now here , I want to share the stage with someone quite special . Right ?
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she &apos;s now one of the youn@@ g@@ est published scientists in the world . Right ? She will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youn@@ g@@ est person to ever speak at TED . Right ?
Now , science and asking questions is about courage .
Now she is the person@@ ification of courage , because she &apos;s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
So A@@ my , would you please come up ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So A@@ my &apos;s going to help me tell the story of what we call the Black@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ es Project , and first she &apos;s going to tell you the question that they came up with . So go ahead , A@@ my .
A@@ my O &apos;@@ To@@ ole : Thank you , B@@ eau . We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look ali@@ ke .
But we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . It &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
Really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previ@@ ously learned rules and conditions . So what if bees can think like us ?
Well , it &apos;d be amazing , since we &apos;re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regard@@ less of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . ( Applause ) B@@ L : So the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . So the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so — well , game — and so , A@@ my , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees ?
AO : The puzzle we came up with was an i@@ f-@@ then rule .
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it &apos;s in a certain pattern .
They were only re@@ war@@ ded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
Now there &apos;s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . The interesting question is , which ?
What was really exciting about this project was we , and B@@ eau , had no idea whether it would work .
It was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . ( Laughter ) B@@ L : In@@ clu@@ ding the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
It &apos;s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clu@@ e what he &apos;s doing , because that &apos;s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what &apos;s going to happen at the end of the day — so much of the credit goes to D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick , who was the collabor@@ ator on this project . Okay ?
So I &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . So here are some of the students doing the observations . They &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
( Video ) D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So what we &apos;re going to do — Stu@@ dent : 5@@ C .
D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : Is she still going up here ? Stu@@ dent : Yeah .
D@@ ave S@@ tru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : So you keep track of ea@@ ch@@ .@@ Stu@@ dent : Henry , can you help me here ?
B@@ L : &quot; &quot; Can you help me , Henry ? &quot; &quot; What good scientist says that , right ?
Stu@@ dent : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
B@@ L : Right ? So we &apos;ve got our observations . We &apos;ve got our data .
They do the simple mathematics , aver@@ aging , etc . , etc .
And now we want to share . That &apos;s the next step .
So we &apos;re going to write this up and try to sub@@ mit this for publication . Right ? So we have to write it up .
So we go , of course , to the pub . All right ? ( Laughter ) The one on the left is mine , okay ? ( Laughter ) Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
The introduction says , what &apos;s the question and why ?
Me@@ tho@@ ds , what did you do ? Res@@ ul@@ ts , what was the observation ?
And the discussion is , who car@@ es ? Right ?
That &apos;s a science paper , basically . ( Laughter ) So the kids give me the words , right ? I put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kid@@ speak .
It &apos;s not written by me . It &apos;s written by A@@ my and the other students in the class . As a consequence , this science paper begins , &quot; &quot; Once upon a time ... &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The results section , it says : &quot; &quot; Tr@@ aining phase , the puzzle ... du@@ h du@@ h du@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ hh@@ h . &quot; &quot; Right ? ( Laughter ) And the methods , it says , &quot; &quot; Then we put the bees into the fri@@ dge ( and made bee p@@ ie ) , &quot; &quot; smil@@ ey face . Right ? ( Laughter ) This is a science paper . We &apos;re going to try to get it published .
So here &apos;s the title page . We have a number of auth@@ ors there .
All the ones in b@@ old are eight to 10 years old .
The first author is Black@@ aw@@ ton Pri@@ mar@@ y School , because if it were ever refer@@ enced , it would be &quot; &quot; Black@@ aw@@ ton et al , &quot; &quot; and not one individual . So we sub@@ mit it to a public access journal , and it says this . It said many things , but it said this .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid the paper fai@@ ls our initial quality control chec@@ ks in several different ways . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In other words , it starts off &quot; &quot; once upon a time , &quot; &quot; the figures are in cr@@ ay@@ on , etc . ( Laughter ) So we said , we &apos;ll get it re@@ viewed . So I sent it to D@@ ale P@@ ur@@ ves , who is at the National Academy of Science , one of the leading neuro@@ scientists in the world , and he says , &quot; &quot; This is the most original science paper I have ever read &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — &quot; and it certainly deser@@ ves wide expos@@ ure . &quot;
Larry Mal@@ on@@ ey , expert in vision , says , &quot; &quot; The paper is magnific@@ ent .
The work would be publ@@ ish@@ able if done by adults . &quot; &quot; So what did we do ? We send it back to the edit@@ or .
They say no .
So we asked Larry and Nat@@ alie H@@ em@@ pel to write a comment@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ dings for scientists , right , putting in the refer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters .
And there , it was re@@ viewed by five independent refer@@ ees , and it was published . Okay ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . ( Laughter ) Ty@@ pical science , actually , right ? So this makes A@@ my and her friends the youn@@ g@@ est published scientists in the world .
What was the feedback like ?
Well , it was published two days before Christmas , down@@ loaded 30,000 times in the first day , right ?
It was the E@@ dit@@ ors &apos; Ch@@ o@@ ice in Science , which is a top science magazine .
It &apos;s forever fre@@ ely accessible by Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters .
It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be fre@@ ely accessible by this journal .
Last year , it was the secon@@ d-@@ most down@@ loaded paper by Bi@@ ology L@@ et@@ ters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
And I &apos;ll just read one .
&quot; &quot; I have read &apos; Black@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ es &apos; recently . I don &apos;t have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now .
What you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
Cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , interest , inno@@ c@@ ence and z@@ e@@ al are the most basic and most important things to do science .
Who else can have these qualities more than children ?
Please con@@ grat@@ ulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
Can I do it on you ? ( Laughter ) Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
Now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ? ( Laughter ) For me , not for him . Right ? Because we &apos;ve only done this once before . ( Laughter ) And you like technology , right ?
Sh@@ im@@ on S@@ cho@@ c@@ ken : Right , but I like myself .
B@@ L : This is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . Right . Okay .
Now ... ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , right ?
You have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me cl@@ apping . All right ?
( Cl@@ apping ) ( Cl@@ apping ) Okay , how about if everyone over there sh@@ outs . One , two , three ?
Audience : ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) ( Laughter ) Br@@ illi@@ ant . Now , open your eyes . We &apos;ll do it one more time .
Everyone over there sh@@ out . ( S@@ hou@@ ts ) Where &apos;s the sound coming from ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What &apos;s the point ? The point is what science does for us .
Right ? We normally walk through life respon@@ ding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . When he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
That &apos;s what science off@@ ers us . It off@@ ers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right ?
Now , true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and en@@ ab@@ ling to express that voice , so I &apos;ve asked A@@ my to be the last voice in this short story .
So , A@@ my ?
AO : This project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and I mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
Ch@@ ang@@ ing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . It all depends on the way the person feels about change .
But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy . Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , I then realized that science isn &apos;t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
You just need an opportunity . My opportunity came in the form of B@@ eau , and the Black@@ aw@@ ton Be@@ e Project .
Thank you@@ .@@ B@@ L : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical Envir@@ on@@ ment@@ alist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
So get out your pen and paper .
Bot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 800 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without san@@ itation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
The l@@ ists go on and on .
There &apos;s two billions of people who will be sever@@ ely affected by climate change — so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communic@@ able diseases , conflicts , education , financial inst@@ ability , governance and corruption , mal@@ nutrition and hunger , population migration , san@@ itation and water , and sub@@ si@@ dies and trade barri@@ ers .
We believe that these in many ways en@@ compas@@ s the biggest problems in the world .
The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
Where should we start on solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in Dav@@ os in January .
But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Su@@ rely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
So the point is not to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze problems , but the point is to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze solutions to problems .
And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
To climate change that would be like Ky@@ oto .
To communic@@ able diseases , it might be health clin@@ ics or mosquito nets .
To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peace@@ keeping forces , and so on .
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ orities .
And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ orities and the bottom pri@@ orities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a substanti@@ al amount of my time , right ?
I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze ?
Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
And one reason is that pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do this .
Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
And since there are many more not@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ing — any decision is a pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation , so of course we are still pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ing , if only impl@@ ic@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ation , and went in and talked about it .
So what I &apos;m propos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of choices .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the si@@ zes .
We have not had an idea .
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big men@@ u card , but you have no idea what the price is .
You know , you have a pi@@ zz@@ a ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a famil@@ y-@@ size pi@@ zz@@ a ; it could be a very individu@@ al-@@ size pi@@ zz@@ a , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the Copenh@@ agen Con@@ sen@@ sus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
And so basically , this has been the Copenh@@ agen Con@@ sen@@ sus &apos; process .
We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wise in communic@@ able diseases .
Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
And so on .
Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , meet in Copenh@@ agen in May 2004 .
We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University pre@@ f@@ ects decided to call them the Re@@ al Mad@@ rid of economics .
That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
And what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed list .
And then you ask , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
If you want to know about climate , you ask a cli@@ mat@@ ologist .
But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
That is what economists do .
They pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze .
They make that in some ways disgu@@ sting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
These were the bad projects .
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll dis@@ agree with on the list that you wrote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that Ky@@ oto — or doing something more than Ky@@ oto — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ efficient .
It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
What they basically show us , the average of all m@@ acro@@ economic models , is that Ky@@ oto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a substanti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
Yet it would do very little good .
All models show it will post@@ po@@ ne warming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a floo@@ d in 2@@ 100 can wait until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
Which is a little good , but not very much good .
So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
We could give clean drinking water , san@@ itation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ ority .
The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communic@@ able diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very co@@ stly .
Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , a lot of san@@ itation and water projects came in .
Again , san@@ itation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ orities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
If we inves@@ ted about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
We could avoid about 5@@ 00,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
We would signific@@ antly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
This third best one was free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut sub@@ si@@ dies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically en@@ liv@@ en the global economy to an as@@ tou@@ n@@ ding number of about 2,@@ 400 billion dollars a year , half of which would accr@@ ue to the Third World .
Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on mal@@ nutrition .
Not just mal@@ nutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with mal@@ nutrition , nam@@ ely , the lack of mic@@ ron@@ u@@ tri@@ ents .
Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ acking in iron , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and vit@@ am@@ in A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe in@@ road into that problem .
That would be the second best investment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does and what it foc@@ uses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment ; the other one is pre@@ vention .
And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than pre@@ vention .
So basically , what this foc@@ uses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in pre@@ vention .
Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ vention .
So again , what we focus on is pre@@ vention rather than treatment , at first rate .
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ orities .
I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ ority list and say , did you get it right ?
Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
And I think , actually — Thomas Sch@@ elling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
Even the most pessim@@ istic impact scen@@ arios of the U.N.
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as rich as we are today .
M@@ uch more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bangladesh in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangl@@ ad@@ es@@ hi .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich D@@ ut@@ ch guy .
And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich D@@ ut@@ ch guy ?
Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bangladesh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very chea@@ ply ?
Or as Sch@@ elling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a rich C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they car@@ ed so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and car@@ ed so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ orities straight .
Even if it doesn &apos;t accord to the typical way we see this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tom@@ orrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Em@@ mer@@ ich to cast Brad P@@ it@@ t in his next movie di@@ gging la@@ tr@@ ines in Tanzan@@ ia or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
So in many ways , I think of the Copenh@@ agen Con@@ sen@@ sus and the whole discussion of pri@@ orities as a defense for boring problems .
To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
The other objec@@ tions , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — pos@@ iting a false choice .
Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 1970 , on the developing world .
Since then our aid has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
Li@@ ke@@ wise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
I &apos;m all for that .
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ orities .
I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inev@@ it@@ ably end up asking old , white American men .
And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
The only two requi@@ rements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
They had all the same material but they could go vas@@ tly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own l@@ ists .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with mal@@ nutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There &apos;s been many other sem@@ in@@ ars and university students , and different things .
They all come out with very much the same list .
And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about pri@@ orities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
I see the Copenh@@ agen Con@@ sen@@ sus as a process .
We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
Ma@@ p out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can dis@@ agree with the discussion of how we actually pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze these , but we have to be honest and fr@@ ank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
If we worry too much about some things , we end by not wor@@ rying about other things .
So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ orities , and think about how we better work for the world .
Thank you .
The year is 18@@ 00 .
A curious little invention is being talked about .
It &apos;s called a microscope .
What it allows you to do is see tiny little life@@ forms that are invisible to the naked eye .
So@@ on comes the medical discovery that many of these life@@ forms are actually causes of terrible human diseases .
Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her te@@ ac@@ up actually was drinking a mon@@ ster sou@@ p , not very far from here . This is from London .
F@@ ast forward 200 years .
We still have this mon@@ ster sou@@ p around , and it &apos;s taken hold in the developing countries around the trop@@ ical bel@@ t .
They all have faces .
And remember that number : one billion .
The problem lies with the microscope itself .
They are heavy , bul@@ ky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
We saw all kinds of don@@ ated equipment .
So what is a F@@ ol@@ d@@ scope ?
A F@@ ol@@ d@@ scope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluor@@ escence , bri@@ ght-@@ field , polar@@ ization , projection , all kinds of advanced microsc@@ opy built pu@@ rely by fol@@ ding paper .
So , now you think , how is that possible ?
We didn &apos;t want to change this , because this is the standard that &apos;s been opti@@ mi@@ zed for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
You pop this in .
And they last , even though they &apos;re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
So up till now , you didn &apos;t actually see what I would see from one of these se@@ tu@@ ps .
What you &apos;re looking at — ( Applause ) — This is a cross-@@ section of a com@@ pound eye , and when I &apos;m going to zoom in closer , right there , I am going through the z-@@ axis .
Another example , one of my favorite insects , I love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you &apos;re seeing the anten@@ na of a cul@@ e@@ x pi@@ pi@@ ens .
Right there .
All from the simple se@@ tu@@ p that I actually described .
So it turns out they &apos;re water@@ proof , and — ( Laughter ) — right here is just fluor@@ escent water , and I don &apos;t know if you can actually see this .
So I &apos;m quickly going to show you , since I &apos;m running out of time , in terms of how much it costs for us to manu@@ fac@@ ture , the biggest idea was ro@@ ll@@ -to-@@ roll manufacturing , so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs .
I &apos;m going to give you a quick sn@@ ap@@ shot of some of the parts that go in .
Here is a sheet of paper .
There are some light sources .
And essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us mic@@ r@@ on-@@ scale precis@@ ion of op@@ tical align@@ ment .
So even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
There it is , and it survi@@ ves .
We are at a stage where we &apos;ll be making thousands of microscop@@ es .
Our world has many super@@ heroes .
But they have the worst of all super@@ powers : in@@ visi@@ bility .
For example , the cat@@ ador@@ es , workers who collect recycl@@ able materials for a living .
C@@ at@@ ador@@ es emerged from social inequality , un@@ employment , and the abun@@ dance of solid waste from the de@@ fici@@ ency of the waste collection system .
C@@ at@@ ador@@ es provide a heavy , honest and essential work that benefits the entire population . But they are not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged for it .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycl@@ ed .
Most of the cat@@ ador@@ es work in@@ depend@@ ently , picking waste from the streets and selling to j@@ unk y@@ ards at very low prices .
Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil , much like gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i and street art .
And this is how I first met these margin@@ alized super@@ heroes .
I am a gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i artist and activis@@ t and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new urban support for my message .
But at this time , giving voice to the cat@@ ador@@ es .
And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ ged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
I have painted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been invited to do exhi@@ bi@@ tions and tri@@ ps worldwide .
And then I realized that cat@@ ador@@ es , in their in@@ visi@@ bility , are not exclu@@ sive to Brazil .
I met them in Argent@@ ina , Chi@@ le , Bo@@ li@@ via , South Africa , Tur@@ key and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
And then , I created a collaborative movement called P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crow@@ d@@ funded event .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça is a large crow@@ d@@ funded event to help cat@@ ador@@ es and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
C@@ at@@ ador@@ es are ass@@ isted by well-being profession@@ als and healthcare , like physici@@ ans , denti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ atr@@ ists , hair sty@@ l@@ ists , mass@@ age therap@@ ists and much more .
But also , they also receive safety shir@@ ts , glo@@ ves , rain@@ co@@ ats and ey@@ e@@ glasses to see in high-@@ definition the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are ren@@ ov@@ ated by our incredible volunteers .
And then they receive safety it@@ ems , too : refl@@ ective tap@@ es , hor@@ ns and mir@@ rors .
Then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça took to the streets of S@@ ã@@ o Pau@@ lo , Rio de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o and Cu@@ ri@@ ti@@ ba .
But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created P@@ imp@@ x , which is inspired by TED@@ x , and it &apos;s a simplifi@@ ed , do@@ -@@ it-@@ yourself , crow@@ d@@ funded e@@ dition of P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça .
So now everybody can join .
In two years , over 1@@ 70 cat@@ ador@@ es , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 don@@ ors have been involved in the P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ça movement , whose actions have even been used in teaching recycl@@ ing at a local school .
So cat@@ ador@@ es are leaving in@@ visi@@ bility behind and becoming increasingly resp@@ ected and valu@@ ed .
Because of their p@@ imp@@ ed car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fight back to pre@@ judi@@ ce , increase their income and their interaction with society .
So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the cat@@ ador@@ es and other invisible super@@ heroes from your city .
T@@ ry to see the world as one , without boundaries or fronti@@ ers .
B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there are over 20 million cat@@ ador@@ es worldwide .
So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
Mu@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , thank you .
( Applause ) .
About a year and a half ago , Stephen L@@ aw@@ ler , who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Vir@@ tual Earth , brought me over to become the architect of B@@ ing M@@ aps , which is Microsoft &apos;s on@@ lin@@ e-@@ m@@ apping effort .
In the past two and a half , we &apos;ve been very hard at work on re@@ defin@@ ing the way maps work online .
And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of m@@ apping and direction site that one is used to .
So , the first thing that you might notice about the m@@ apping site is just the flu@@ id@@ ity of the zoom@@ ing and the p@@ ann@@ ing , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with S@@ ea@@ drag@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from .
M@@ apping is , of course , not just about carto@@ graphy , it &apos;s also about imagery .
So , as we zoom@@ -@@ in beyond a certain level this resol@@ ves into a kind of Si@@ m C@@ it@@ y-@@ like virtual view at 45 degrees .
This can be viewed from any of the car@@ din@@ al directions to show you the 3D structure of the city , all the fac@@ ades .
Now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a can@@ vas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
If you click on this , you &apos;ll see some of the ones that we &apos;ve put out , just in the past couple of months since we &apos;ve launched .
So , for example , a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti , we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky .
This wonderful one which I don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper@@ -@@ local blogs in real time and m@@ apping those stories , those en@@ tries to the places that are refer@@ red to on the blogs .
It &apos;s wonderful .
But I &apos;m going to show you some more cand@@ y sort of stuff .
So , we see the imagery , of course , not stop@@ ping at the sky .
These little green bubbles represent photo@@ syn@@ ths that users have made .
I &apos;m not going to dive into them either , but photo@@ syn@@ ths are integrated into the map .
Everything that &apos;s cas@@ ed in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
And so , when you fly down — ( Applause ) Thank you . When you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imagery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above , so if I click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geom@@ etry , all of that 3D understanding behind this model .
Now , I &apos;ll show you a fun app that — we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at F@@ lic@@ k@@ r .
This takes F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , ge@@ o@@ regis@@ tered imagery and uses photo@@ syn@@ th-@@ like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery , so — I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s the one I actually meant to pull up , but — ( Laughter ) But notice — this is , of course , a popular tour@@ ist site , and there are lots of photos around here , and these photos are all taken at different times .
So this one was taken around five .
So that &apos;s the F@@ lic@@ k@@ r photo , that &apos;s our imagery .
So you really see how this kind of crow@@ d-@@ sourc@@ ed imagery is integr@@ ating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them , of course , is time travel .
And I &apos;m not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here , but there are some with hor@@ ses and car@@ ri@@ ages and so on as well .
But what &apos;s cool about this is that , not only is it augment@@ ing this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users , but it also is the foundation for augment@@ ed reality , and that &apos;s something that I &apos;ll be showing you more of in just a moment .
Now I just made a transition in@@ doors . That &apos;s also interesting .
OK , notice there &apos;s now a roof above us .
We &apos;re inside the Pi@@ ke Pl@@ ace Mar@@ ket .
And this is something that we &apos;re able to do with a back@@ pack camera , so , we &apos;re now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars , but we &apos;re also imaging inside .
And from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of reg@@ istr@@ ation , not only of still images , but also of video .
So this is something that we &apos;re now going to try for the first time , live , and this is really , truly , very frighten@@ ing .
( Laughter ) OK .
( R@@ inging ) All right , guys , are you there ?
( No@@ ise ) All right . I &apos;m hitting it . I &apos;m pun@@ ching play .
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
So , these are our friends in Pi@@ ke Pl@@ ace Mar@@ ket , the lab .
( Applause ) So they &apos;re broad@@ cas@@ ting this live .
OK , George , can you p@@ an back over to the corner market ?
Because I want to show points of interest .
No , no . The other way .
Yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
OK , OK , back to the corner , back to the corner , back to the corner .
OK , never mind .
What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way , if you &apos;re actually on the spot , you can think about this — this is taking a step in addition to augment@@ ed reality .
What the hell are you guys — oh , sorry .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re doing two different — OK , I &apos;m hanging up now .
We &apos;re doing two different things here .
One of them is to take that real ...
( Laughter ) All right , let me just take a moment and thank the team .
They &apos;ve done a fantastic job of pulling this together .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to aband@@ on them now and walk back outside .
And while I walk outside , I &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for tele@@ presence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augment@@ ed reality .
When you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that met@@ ad@@ ata and information about the world to you .
So here , we &apos;re taking the extra step of also broad@@ cas@@ ting it .
That was being broad@@ cast , by the way , on a 4@@ G network from the market .
All right , and now there &apos;s one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years .
And that &apos;s Cur@@ tis W@@ ong , World@@ W@@ ide Tel@@ escope .
So , we &apos;re going to head over to the dum@@ p@@ sters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also st@@ are up at the sky .
This is the integr@@ ation of World@@ W@@ ide Tel@@ escope into our maps .
( Applause ) This is the current — thank you — this is the current time . If we s@@ cru@@ b the time , then we can see how the sky will look at different times , and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times , different dates : Let &apos;s move the moon a little higher in the sky , maybe change the date .
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
So , this is an astronom@@ ically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth .
All right now , I &apos;ve over@@ run my time , so I &apos;ve got to stop .
Thank you all very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to tell you two things today : One is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
And let me start with this .
This is my bas@@ eline : This is the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an coast with no fish , b@@ are rock and lots of sea ur@@ ch@@ ins that like to eat the algae .
Something like this is what I first saw when I jumped in the water for the first time in the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an coast off Spain .
Now , if an alien came to earth — let &apos;s call him Joe — what would Joe see ?
If Joe jumped in a coral re@@ ef , there are many things the alien could see .
Very unlikely , Joe would jump on a pr@@ ist@@ ine coral re@@ ef , a vir@@ gin coral re@@ ef with lots of coral , sharks , cro@@ codi@@ les , man@@ at@@ ees , grou@@ pers , tur@@ tles , etc .
So , probably , what Joe would see would be in this part , in the green@@ ish part of the picture .
Here we have the extreme with dead corals , microbial sou@@ p and jellyfish .
And where the di@@ ver is , this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now , with very few corals , algae over@@ growing the corals , lots of bacteria , and where the large animals are gone .
And this is what most marine scientists have seen too .
This is their bas@@ eline . This is what they think is natural because we started modern science with s@@ cu@@ ba diving long after we started degrad@@ ing marine ecosystems .
So I &apos;m going to get us all on a time machine , and we &apos;re going to the left ; we &apos;re going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like .
And let &apos;s start with this time machine , the L@@ ine Isl@@ ands , where we have conduc@@ ted a series of National Geographic expe@@ di@@ tions .
This sea is an arch@@ i@@ pel@@ ago bel@@ ong@@ ing to Ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i that sp@@ ans across the equ@@ ator and it has several un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited , un@@ f@@ ished , pr@@ ist@@ ine is@@ lands and a few in@@ hab@@ ited is@@ lands .
So let &apos;s start with the first one : Christmas Island , over 5,000 people .
Most of the reefs are dead , most of the corals are dead — over@@ grown by algae — and most of the fish are smaller than the pen@@ c@@ ils we use to count them .
We did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
This is the place that Cap@@ tain Co@@ ok discovered in 17@@ 7@@ 7 and he described a huge abun@@ dance of sharks b@@ iting the ru@@ dd@@ ers and the o@@ ars of their small bo@@ ats while they were going as@@ hore .
Let &apos;s move the di@@ al a little bit to the past .
F@@ ann@@ ing Island , 2,@@ 500 people .
The corals are doing better here . L@@ ots of small fish .
This is what many divers would consider par@@ a@@ dise .
This is where you can see most of the Florida K@@ ey@@ s National Mar@@ ine S@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
And many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ eline .
If we go back to a place like Pal@@ my@@ ra At@@ ol@@ l , where I was with Jer@@ em@@ y Jack@@ son a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
You can see sharks in every single dive .
And this is something that is very unusual in today &apos;s coral reefs .
But then , if we shift the di@@ al 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gor@@ ge@@ ous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predat@@ ors are the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
What have we learned from these places ?
This is what we thought was natural .
This is what we call the biom@@ ass pyramid .
If we get all of the fish of a coral re@@ ef together and we@@ igh them , this is what we would expect .
Most of the biom@@ ass is low on the food chain , the her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , the par@@ rot@@ fish , the surge@@ on@@ fish that eat the algae .
Then the plan@@ k@@ ton fe@@ e@@ ders , these little dam@@ sel@@ fish , the little animals floating in the water .
And then we have a lower biom@@ ass of car@@ ni@@ v@@ ores , and a lower biom@@ ass of top head , or the sharks , the large sn@@ ap@@ pers , the large grou@@ pers .
But this is a consequence .
This view of the world is a consequence of having studied degrad@@ ed reefs .
When we went to pr@@ ist@@ ine reefs , we realized that the natural world was up@@ side down ; this pyramid was in@@ ver@@ ted .
The top head does account for most of the biom@@ ass , in some places up to 85 percent , like K@@ ing@@ man Re@@ ef , which is now protected .
The good news is that , in addition to having more predat@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything .
The size of these boxes is bigger .
We have more sharks , more biom@@ ass of sn@@ ap@@ pers , more biom@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , too , like these par@@ ro@@ t fish that are like marine go@@ ats .
They clean the re@@ ef ; everything that grows enough to be seen , they eat , and they keep the re@@ ef clean and allow the corals to repl@@ en@@ ish .
Not only do these places — these ancient , pr@@ ist@@ ine places — have lots of fish , but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant cl@@ ams ; pav@@ ements of giant cl@@ ams in the l@@ ago@@ ons , up to 20 , 25 per square meter .
These have disappeared from every in@@ hab@@ ited re@@ ef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and patho@@ gens .
But still , now we have global warming .
If we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their rem@@ ot@@ eness , this is great .
But the water gets war@@ mer for too long and the corals die .
So how are these fish , these predat@@ ors going to help ?
Well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during El N@@ ino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bl@@ ea@@ ched and many died .
In Christmas , where the food web is really tr@@ imm@@ ed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not re@@ covered .
In F@@ ann@@ ing Island , the corals are not re@@ covered .
But you see here a big table coral that died and collap@@ sed .
And the fish have gr@@ az@@ ed the algae , so the tur@@ f of algae is a little lower .
Then you go to Pal@@ my@@ ra At@@ ol@@ l that has more biom@@ ass of her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores , and the dead corals are clean , and the corals are coming back .
And when you go to the pr@@ ist@@ ine side , did this ever ble@@ ach ?
These places bl@@ ea@@ ched too , but they re@@ covered faster .
The more intact , the more complete , &#91; and &#93; the more complex your food web , the higher the res@@ ilience , &#91; and &#93; the more likely that the system is going to recover from the shor@@ t-@@ term impacts of warming events .
And that &apos;s good news , so we need to recover that structure .
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of global warming .
So if we have to res@@ et the bas@@ eline , if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left , how can we do it ?
Well , there are several ways .
One very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
And let me go back to that image of the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
This was my bas@@ eline . This is what I saw when I was a kid .
And at the same time I was watching Jac@@ ques Cou@@ st@@ eau &apos;s shows on TV , with all this rich@@ ness and abun@@ dance and diversity .
And I thought that this rich@@ ness bel@@ ong@@ ed to trop@@ ical seas , and that the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an was a naturally poor sea .
But , little did I know , until I jumped for the first time in a marine reser@@ ve .
And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
After a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the algae grow again .
So you have this little alg@@ al forest , and in the size of a laptop you can find more than 100 species of algae , mostly microscop@@ ic fit hundreds of species of little animals that then feed the fish , so that the system reco@@ vers .
And this particular place , the Me@@ des Isl@@ ands Mar@@ ine Res@@ er@@ ve , is only 9@@ 4 hectares , and it brings 6 million euro@@ s to the local economy , 20 times more than fishing , and it represents 8@@ 8 percent of all the tour@@ ist revenue .
So these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem .
So let me just give you a summar@@ y of what no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ves do .
These places , when we protect them , if we compare them to un@@ protected areas near@@ by , this is what happens .
The number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reser@@ ve .
This is very substanti@@ al .
The size of organisms increases a third , so your fish are now this big .
The abun@@ dance , how many fish you have per square meter , increases almost 1@@ 70 percent .
And the biom@@ ass — this is the most spectacular change — 4@@ .@@ 5 times greater biom@@ ass on average , just after five to seven years .
In some places up to 10 times larger biom@@ ass inside the reser@@ ves .
So we have all these things inside the reser@@ ve that grow , and what do they do ?
They re@@ produce . That &apos;s population biology 10@@ 1 .
If you don &apos;t kill the fish , they take a longer time to die , they grow larger and they re@@ produce a lot .
And same thing for in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates . This is the example .
These are eg@@ g cases laid by a sn@@ ail off the coast of Chi@@ le , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
Ou@@ t@@ side the reser@@ ve , you cannot even detect this .
One point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reser@@ ve where these sn@@ ails are very abun@@ dant .
So these organisms re@@ produce , the little lar@@ v@@ ae ju@@ ven@@ iles sp@@ ill over , they all sp@@ ill over , and then people can benefit from them outside too .
This is in the B@@ ah@@ amas : N@@ ass@@ au grou@@ per .
Hu@@ ge abun@@ dance of grou@@ pers inside the reser@@ ve , and the closer you get to the reser@@ ve , the more fish you have .
So the fish@@ er@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
You can see where the limits of the reser@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats lined up .
So there is sp@@ ill over ; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reser@@ ves that help people around them , while at the same time the reser@@ ve is protecting the entire habitat . It is building res@@ ilience .
So what we have now — or a world without reser@@ ves — is like a de@@ bit account where we with@@ draw all the time and we never make any de@@ pos@@ it .
Res@@ er@@ ves are like savings accoun@@ ts .
We have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces re@@ turns , social , economic and ecological .
And if we think about the increase of biom@@ ass inside the reser@@ ves , this is like com@@ pound interest .
Two examples , again , of how these reser@@ ves can benefit people .
This is how much fish@@ er@@ men get everyday in Kenya , fishing over a series of years , in a place where there is no protection ; it &apos;s a fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all .
Once the most degrad@@ ing fishing g@@ ear , se@@ ine nets , were removed , the fish@@ er@@ men were cat@@ ching more .
If you fish less , you &apos;re actually cat@@ ching more .
But if we add the no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ve on top of that , the fish@@ er@@ men are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
Another example : N@@ ass@@ au grou@@ pers in Bel@@ ize in the Mes@@ o@@ am@@ er@@ ican Re@@ ef .
This is grou@@ per sex , and the grou@@ pers aggre@@ gate around the full mo@@ ons of Dec@@ ember and January for a week .
They used to aggre@@ gate up to the tens of thousands , 30,000 grou@@ pers about this big in one hect@@ are , in one aggre@@ gation .
F@@ ish@@ er@@ men knew about these things ; they caught them , and they de@@ pl@@ eted them .
When I went there for the first time in 2000 , there were only 3,000 grou@@ pers left .
And the fish@@ er@@ men were author@@ ized to catch 30 percent of the entire sp@@ aw@@ ning population every year .
So we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fish@@ ery is going to collapse very quickly .
And with the fish@@ ery , the entire re@@ productive ability of the species goes extinct .
It happened in many places around the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
And they would make 4,000 dollars per year , total , for the entire fish@@ ery , several fishing bo@@ ats .
Now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
So how much of this do we have ?
If this is so good , if this is such a no@@ -@@ br@@ ainer , how much of this do we have ?
And you already heard that less than one percent of the ocean &apos;s protected .
We &apos;re getting closer to one percent now , thanks to the prot@@ ections of the Ch@@ agos Ar@@ chi@@ pel@@ ago , and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing .
Scienti@@ fic studies recomm@@ end that at least 20 percent of the ocean should be protected .
The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fish@@ ery enh@@ anc@@ ement and res@@ ilience .
Now , is this possible ? People would ask : How much would that cost ?
Well , let &apos;s think about how much we are paying now to sub@@ si@@ di@@ ze fishing : 35 billion dollars per year .
Many of these sub@@ si@@ dies go to destruc@@ tive fishing practices .
Well , there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering 20 percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying ; the government hands out to a fish@@ ery that is collap@@ sing .
People are losing their jobs because the fish@@ eries are collap@@ sing .
A creation of a network of reser@@ ves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the second@@ ary jobs and all the second@@ ary benefits .
So how can we do that ?
If it &apos;s so clear that these savings accoun@@ ts are good for the environment and for people , why don &apos;t we have 20 , 50 percent of the ocean ?
And how can we reach that goal ?
Well , there are two ways of getting there .
The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the Ch@@ agos Ar@@ chi@@ pel@@ ago .
The problem is that we can create these large reser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
And a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
But what about the rest of the coast of the world , where people live and make a living out of fishing ?
Well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reser@@ ves : The first one is that people have no idea what marine reser@@ ves do , and fish@@ er@@ men tend to be really , really def@@ en@@ sive when it comes to regul@@ ating or closing an area , even if it &apos;s small .
Second , the governance is not right because most co@@ as@@ tal communities around the world don &apos;t have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reser@@ ve and en@@ force it .
It &apos;s a top down hier@@ arch@@ ical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . And the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
Which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reser@@ ves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
N@@ G@@ Os and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
So marine conservation and co@@ as@@ tal protection has become a sin@@ k for government or philanthro@@ pic money , and this is not sustainable .
So the solutions are just fix@@ ing these three issues .
First , we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments to create no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ves that are better than what we have now .
It &apos;s the savings accoun@@ ts versus the de@@ bit accoun@@ ts with no de@@ pos@@ its .
Second , we need to re@@ design our governance so conservation efforts can be dec@@ entr@@ alized , so conservation efforts don &apos;t depend on work from N@@ G@@ Os or from government agencies and can be created by the local communities , like it happens in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines and a few other places .
And third , and very important , we need to develop new business models .
The philanthrop@@ y sin@@ k as the only way to create reser@@ ves is not sustainable .
We really need to develop models , business models , where co@@ as@@ tal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reser@@ ves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
And I &apos;d like to finish with one thought , which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean .
There has been a lot of competition in the past , and we need to develop a new model of part@@ nership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for compl@@ ement@@ ing , not substitu@@ ting .
The st@@ akes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
So let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Thank you En@@ ri@@ c .
En@@ ri@@ c Sal@@ a : Thank you .
CA : That was a mas@@ ter@@ ful job of pulling things together .
First of all , your pyramid , your in@@ ver@@ ted pyramid , showing 85 percent biom@@ ass in the predat@@ ors , that seems impossible .
How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
ES : Well , imagine that you have two g@@ ears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
The big one is moving very slowly , and the small one is moving fast .
That &apos;s basically it .
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain , they re@@ produce very fast ; they grow really fast ; they produce millions of eggs .
Up there , you have sharks and large fish that live 25 , 30 years .
They re@@ produce very slowly ; they have a slow met@@ abol@@ ism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biom@@ ass .
So , basically , the production sur@@ plus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biom@@ ass that is not moving .
They are like capac@@ it@@ ors of the system .
CA : That &apos;s very fascinating .
So , really , our picture of a food pyramid is just — we have to change that completely .
ES : At least in the seas .
What we found in coral reefs is that the in@@ ver@@ ted pyramid is the equivalent of the Ser@@ eng@@ et@@ i , with five lions per wil@@ de@@ be@@ est .
And on land , this cannot work .
But at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure .
We think this is universal .
But we have started studying pr@@ ist@@ ine reefs only very recently .
CA : So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .
You &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on sub@@ si@@ dies .
It would only cost 16 billion to set up 20 percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living choices to the fish@@ er@@ men as well .
If the world was a smarter place , we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars .
We &apos;ve got 19 billion to spend on health care or something .
ES : And then we have the under@@ -@@ performance of fish@@ eries that is 50 billion dollars .
So again , one of the big solutions is have the World Trade Organ@@ ization shifting the sub@@ si@@ dies to sustainable practices .
CA : Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of examples that I &apos;m hearing out there about ending this sub@@ si@@ dies ma@@ dness .
So thank you for those numbers .
The last one &apos;s a personal question .
A lot of the experience of people here who &apos;ve been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this degrad@@ ation , the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse , de@@ pressing .
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pr@@ ist@@ ine areas and seeing things coming back .
ES : It is a spiritual experience .
We go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
But the best feeling is this bi@@ oph@@ il@@ ia that E.@@ O@@ . Wil@@ son talks about , where humans have this sense of a@@ we and wonder in front of un@@ t@@ amed nature , of raw nature .
And there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
And if it were not for these places that show hope , I don &apos;t think I could continue doing this job .
It would be just too de@@ pressing .
CA : Well , En@@ ri@@ c , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . Thank you .
ES : Thank you very much .
So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Pro@@ vi@@ dence , R@@ ho@@ de Island to Por@@ t@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on .
And you know , we &apos;re young and un@@ employ@@ ed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state par@@ ks and national forests — basically the long@@ est route we can possibly take .
And somewhere in the middle of South D@@ ak@@ ota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2,000 miles .
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
My friend looks at me totally blan@@ kly .
There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect im@@ itation of her look .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot; &quot; She just star@@ es at me for a few moments , and then she cr@@ acks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
( Laughter ) Right , the famous Chinese character for pic@@ ni@@ c area . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this — why we sometimes mis@@ understand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
We get it in the abstract .
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
The human species , in general , is f@@ alli@@ ble — okay fine .
But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present ten@@ se , suddenly all of this abstract appreci@@ ation of f@@ alli@@ bility goes out the window — and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
And the thing is , the present ten@@ se is where we live .
We go to meetings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and vote in the present ten@@ se .
So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , tr@@ apped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
I think this is a problem .
I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collec@@ tively as a culture .
So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
So let me ask you guys something — or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel — emo@@ tionally — how does it feel to be wrong ?
D@@ read@@ ful . Th@@ um@@ bs down .
Em@@ b@@ arrass@@ ing . Okay , wonderful , great .
D@@ read@@ ful , thum@@ bs down , embarrass@@ ing — thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
You guys are answer@@ ing the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
( Laughter ) Re@@ alizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
I mean it can be devas@@ tat@@ ing , it can be re@@ vel@@ atory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an analo@@ gy .
Do you remember that Lo@@ ony T@@ unes cartoon where there &apos;s this pa@@ thetic co@@ y@@ ote who &apos;s always ch@@ asing and never cat@@ ching a ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner ?
In pretty much every ep@@ isode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the co@@ y@@ ote is ch@@ asing the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner and the ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner runs off a cli@@ ff , which is fine — he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
But the thing is , the co@@ y@@ ote runs off the cli@@ ff right after him .
And what &apos;s funny — at least if you &apos;re six years old — is that the co@@ y@@ ote &apos;s totally fine too .
He just keeps running — right up until the moment that he looks down and realiz@@ es that he &apos;s in mid-@@ air .
That &apos;s when he falls .
When we &apos;re wrong about something — not when we realize it , but before that — we &apos;re like that co@@ y@@ ote after he &apos;s gone off the cli@@ ff and before he looks down .
You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
( Laughter ) So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of ri@@ ght@@ ness .
I call this error blind@@ ness .
Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well — and this one is cultural .
Think back for a moment to el@@ ement@@ ary school .
You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is h@@ anding back qui@@ z papers , and one of them looks like this .
This is not mine , by the way .
( Laughter ) So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
It &apos;s the dum@@ b kid , the trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker , the one who never does his hom@@ ework .
So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are la@@ zy , ir@@ responsible di@@ m@@ wit@@ s — and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
We learn these really bad lessons really well .
And a lot of us — and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room — deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ists , over@@ -@@ achiev@@ ers .
Right , Mr. C@@ F@@ O , astr@@ op@@ hys@@ ic@@ ist , ultra-@@ mar@@ ath@@ oner ?
( Laughter ) You &apos;re all C@@ F@@ O , astr@@ op@@ hys@@ ic@@ ists , ultra-@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out .
Okay , so fine .
Ex@@ cept that then we fre@@ ak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
So we just ins@@ ist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtu@@ ous and safe .
So let me tell you a story .
A couple of years ago , a woman comes into B@@ eth Israel De@@ ac@@ on@@ ess Medic@@ al Center for a surgery .
B@@ eth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard — one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
She &apos;s an@@ es@@ the@@ ti@@ zed , the surgeon does his thing — sti@@ t@@ ches her back up , s@@ ends her out to the recovery room .
Everything seems to have gone fine .
And she w@@ akes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in band@@ ages ? &quot; &quot; Well the wrong side of her body is in band@@ ages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
When the vice president for health care quality at B@@ eth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The point of this story is that tru@@ sting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
This internal sense of ri@@ ght@@ ness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the extern@@ al world .
And when we act like it is , and we stop entert@@ aining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dum@@ ping 200 million g@@ allons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or tor@@ pe@@ doing the global economy .
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who dis@@ agree with you ?
It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by res@@ or@@ ting to a series of un@@ fortunate assumptions .
The first thing we usually do when someone dis@@ agre@@ es with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignor@@ ant .
They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we gener@@ ously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still dis@@ agree with us , then we move on to a second assum@@ ption , which is that they &apos;re idi@@ ots .
( Laughter ) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too mor@@ onic to put them together correc@@ tly .
And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who dis@@ agree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assum@@ ption : they know the truth , and they are deliber@@ ately dist@@ or@@ ting it for their own mal@@ evol@@ ent pur@@ poses .
So this is a catastrophe .
This atta@@ ch@@ ment to our own ri@@ ght@@ ness keeps us from prev@@ enting mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terri@@ bly .
But to me , what &apos;s most b@@ aff@@ ling and most tragic about this is that it mis@@ ses the whole point of being human .
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly trans@@ luc@@ ent windows and we just gaz@@ e out of them and describe the world as it un@@ fol@@ ds .
And we want everybody else to gaz@@ e out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
1,@@ 200 years before Des@@ cartes said his famous thing about &quot; &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; &quot; this guy , St@@ . Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine , sat down and wrote &quot; &quot; F@@ allo@@ r er@@ go sum &quot; &quot; — &quot; I er@@ r therefore I am . &quot;
Au@@ gu@@ st@@ ine understood that our capacity to scre@@ w up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrass@@ ing def@@ ect in the human system , something we can eradic@@ ate or overcome .
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of ep@@ is@@ odes of the Public R@@ adi@@ o show This American Life .
And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
And my first thought was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
I &apos;ve become the crazy wr@@ ong@@ ness lady .
I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; &quot; which has happened .
But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview I@@ ra Gl@@ ass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
In fact , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single ep@@ isode of our show has the same cryp@@ to-@@ theme .
And the cryp@@ to-@@ theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; says I@@ ra Gl@@ ass , &quot; &quot; we need this .
We need these moments of surprise and re@@ vers@@ al and wr@@ ong@@ ness to make these stories work . &quot; &quot; And for the rest of us , audience members , as listen@@ ers , as read@@ ers , we eat this stuff up .
We love things like plot tw@@ ists and red her@@ r@@ ings and surprise end@@ ings .
When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
George Bush thought he was going to inv@@ ade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liber@@ ate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened instead .
And H@@ os@@ ni Mu@@ bar@@ ak thought he was going to be the dictat@@ or of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the re@@ ign@@ s of power onto his son .
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school s@@ wee@@ the@@ art and move back to your hom@@ etown and raise a bunch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly ner@@ dy book about a subject everybody h@@ ates for an audience that would never mater@@ i@@ alize .
And something else happened instead .
( Laughter ) I mean , this is life .
For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and aston@@ ishes us .
No off@@ ense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable mon@@ u@@ ment to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and adv@@ anc@@ ements and impro@@ vements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and adv@@ anc@@ ements and impro@@ vements ?
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-@@ bo@@ ggl@@ ing and worl@@ d-@@ al@@ tering — TED 1998 — eh .
( Laughter ) D@@ id@@ n &apos;t really work out that way , did it ? ( Laughter )
Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the re@@ discovery of wonder .
And to me , if you really want to re@@ discover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the vas@@ t@@ ness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you guys . ( Applause )
On No@@ vember 5@@ th , 1990 , a man named El@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assass@@ inated R@@ abb@@ i Me@@ ir K@@ ah@@ ane , the leader of the Jewish De@@ fen@@ se Le@@ ague .
S@@ ad@@ ly , the 1993 bomb@@ ing of the World Trade Center was not .
N@@ os@@ air would eventually be convic@@ ted for his invol@@ vement in the plot .
El@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
A few months pri@@ or to his arr@@ est , he sat me down and explained that for the past few week@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice .
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
That day , the last bul@@ let I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target bur@@ st into flam@@ es .
My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arab@@ ic said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
Those men would eventually be convic@@ ted of placing a van filled with 1,@@ 500 pounds of explo@@ sives into the sub-@@ level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North To@@ wer , causing an explosion that killed six people and inju@@ red over 1,000 others .
These were the men I looked up to .
These were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means uncle .
By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that inst@@ ability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
Be@@ ing the perpe@@ tual new face in class , I was frequ@@ ently the target of bul@@ lies .
I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbitr@@ ary measu@@ rements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiences that challeng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 2000 pres@@ identi@@ al elections .
Th@@ rough a college pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the National You@@ th Con@@ vention in Philadelph@@ ia .
My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bul@@ lying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
One day toward the end of the con@@ vention , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ ended was Jewish .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to overcome a barri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insur@@ m@@ oun@@ table .
Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Bus@@ ch G@@ ard@@ ens , an am@@ usement park .
There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of fai@@ ths and cultures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that homosexu@@ ality was a s@@ in , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
Be@@ ing bul@@ li@@ ed as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very un@@ naturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stere@@ oty@@ pes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
Then there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how . &quot; &quot; On a ni@@ ghtly basis , J@@ on Ste@@ w@@ art forced me to be intell@@ ec@@ tually honest with myself about my own bi@@ got@@ ry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desper@@ ate need of one .
In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hat@@ red inside of you .
Z@@ ak E@@ br@@ a@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
I do it in the hop@@ es that perhaps someone someday who is comp@@ elled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subj@@ ected to this violent , int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ ology , that I did not become f@@ an@@ atici@@ zed .
For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess acts and con@@ dem@@ n my father &apos;s actions .
And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inher@@ ent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
I am not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
I &apos;m deli@@ ghted to be here .
I &apos;m hon@@ ored by the inv@@ itation , and thanks .
I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
First off , my bad@@ ge says I &apos;m an astronom@@ er .
I would love to talk about my astronom@@ y , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radi@@ ative transfer in non-@@ gray atmosp@@ her@@ es and polar@@ ization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
( Laughter ) It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 198@@ 6 and 198@@ 7 , when a computer hack@@ er is breaking into our systems over at La@@ wr@@ ence Berkeley L@@ abs .
And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet K@@ G@@ B , and ste@@ aling information and selling it .
And I &apos;d love to talk about that — and it &apos;d be fun — but , 20 years later ...
I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
It &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
I &apos;m — The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
A third time , it &apos;s just being a techn@@ ician .
I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
N@@ or am I going to talk about what I think are obvious stat@@ ements from my first book , &quot; &quot; Silicon S@@ n@@ ake O@@ il , &quot; &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t bel@@ ong in schools .
I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
My idea is : no ! No !
Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hun@@ g around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about — but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
So don &apos;t go back and read my dis@@ ser@@ tation .
It probably has lies in it as well .
H@@ aving said that , I out@@ lined my talk about five minutes ago .
( Laughter ) And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thum@@ b was the future .
I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technolo@@ g@@ ist , a scientist , a physicist .
No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teacher .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teacher , ask an experienced one .
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
I don &apos;t . N@@ or , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
Cert@@ ain@@ ly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomen@@ ally good at text mess@@ aging and spend a huge amount of on-@@ screen time , but have never gone bo@@ w@@ ling together ?
Ch@@ ange is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
Oh — the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-@@ si@@ ded things .
I would de@@ arly love to talk about things that have one side .
Because I love Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ ops . I not only love Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ ops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tles .
Right away , I hope that all of your eyes g@@ la@@ ze over .
This is a K@@ le@@ in bottle .
For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , y@@ up , I know all about it .
It &apos;s one si@@ ded . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-@@ orient@@ able .
It has wonderful properties .
If you take two Mo@@ bi@@ us lo@@ ops and se@@ w their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because — ( Laughter ) ( Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a cold . ) However , the &quot; &quot; D &quot; &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
Just two weeks ago I made — you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big K@@ le@@ in bot@@ tles for the trade .
But what I &apos;ve just made — and I &apos;m deli@@ ghted to show you , first time in public here .
This is a K@@ le@@ in bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold flu@@ ids .
So it &apos;s highly — that one &apos;s the cool one .
That was a month of my life .
But although I would love to talk about to@@ po@@ logy with you , I &apos;m not going to .
( Laughter ) Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
H@@ ad collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
Could somebody put this guy up ?
And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing — well , sitting — in 196@@ 9 , in front of a bunch of di@@ als .
And I looked at it , and said , oh my go@@ d , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
As a techn@@ ician , rep@@ air@@ ing and ma@@ int@@ aining the electronic music studio at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o . And w@@ ow !
W@@ ay back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
And it sent me back .
So@@ on after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
This guy over here of course is me .
This man is Robert Moo@@ g , the invent@@ or of the Moo@@ g synthes@@ iz@@ er , who passed away this past Au@@ gust .
Robert Moo@@ g was a generous , kind person , extraordin@@ arily comp@@ et@@ ent engineer .
A musici@@ an who took time from his life to teach me , a sop@@ hom@@ ore , a fres@@ h@@ man at S@@ U@@ N@@ Y Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o .
He &apos;d come up from Tr@@ um@@ ans@@ burg to teach me not just about the Moo@@ g synthes@@ iz@@ er , but we &apos;d be sitting there — I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 196@@ 9 , 70 , 7@@ 1 .
We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot; &quot; M@@ ent@@ oring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
He wrote a letter of recomm@@ end@@ ation for me to get into graduate school .
In the background , my bicycle .
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
Bob Moo@@ g came by and hau@@ led a whole pile of equipment to show Gre@@ g F@@ lin@@ t and I things about this .
We sat around talking about F@@ ou@@ rier transform@@ s , B@@ es@@ sel functions , mod@@ ulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
Any@@ one who &apos;s a musici@@ an has been profoundly influ@@ enced by Robert Moo@@ g .
( Applause ) And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do — I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a dist@@ or@@ ted s@@ ine wave , almost a tri@@ ang@@ ular wave upon this He@@ w@@ let@@ t-@@ P@@ ack@@ ard osc@@ il@@ lo@@ scope .
Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
K@@ ids . K@@ ids is what I &apos;m going to talk about — is that okay ?
It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
So I think loc@@ ally and I act loc@@ ally .
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very loc@@ ally .
So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the y@@ ad@@ da y@@ ad@@ da .
I was talking about this stuff to some school@@ teachers about a year ago .
And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate — I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught under@@ graduate classes . &quot; &quot; No , they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
P@@ ut your money where you mouth is . &quot; &quot; Is true . Is true . I teach eigh@@ th-@@ grade science four days a week .
Not just showing up every now and then .
No , no , no , no , no . I take attend@@ ance .
I take lunch hour . ( Applause ) This is not — no , no , no , this is not cl@@ aps .
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
Not just show up to class every now and then .
T@@ each a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-@@ quarters time , but good enough .
One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you colle@@ ge-@@ level physics .
No calcul@@ us , I &apos;ll cut out that .
You won &apos;t need to know tri@@ g .
But you will need to know eigh@@ th-@@ grade al@@ ge@@ bra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
None of this open-@@ to-@@ chap@@ ter-@@ sev@@ en-@@ and-@@ do@@ -@@ all-@@ the-@@ o@@ dd@@ -@@ problem@@ -@@ sets .
We &apos;re going to be doing genu@@ ine physics . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
( High@@ -@@ pit@@ ched tone ) Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class — this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
My students in El Cer@@ ri@@ to — with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up osc@@ il@@ lo@@ scope — measured the speed of light .
We were off by 25 percent . How many eigh@@ th grad@@ ers do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; &quot; A@@ w man , &quot; &quot; I was just going to im@@ pose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
But mean@@ while , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to boun@@ ce sound off something and look at the ech@@ o .
But , probably — one of my students , Ari@@ el &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the w@@ av@@ el@@ ength of any wave ...
is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the w@@ av@@ el@@ ength comes down . W@@ av@@ el@@ ength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here — over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting — as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stret@@ ch out .
Right ? This is simple physics .
All of you know this from eigh@@ th grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics — in eigh@@ th-@@ grade physics — but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multi@@ ply the frequency times the w@@ av@@ el@@ ength of sound or light , you get a constant .
And that constant is the speed of sound .
So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
I &apos;ve got a frequency coun@@ ter right here .
S@@ et it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
Now , so I know the frequency .
It &apos;s 1.@@ 7@@ 6 kilo@@ her@@ tz . I measure its w@@ av@@ el@@ ength .
All I need now is to flip on another bea@@ m , and the bottom bea@@ m is me talking , right ?
So any@@ time I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spir@@ al .
The s@@ lin@@ ky moves . We &apos;re going through different no@@ des of the wave , coming out this way .
Those of you who are physic@@ ists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me . ( Laughter ) To measure the w@@ av@@ el@@ ength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here — one full wave — over to here .
From here to here is the w@@ av@@ el@@ ength of sound .
So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centi@@ meters .
0.@@ 2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centi@@ meters .
OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. El@@ mo .
And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.@@ 7@@ 6 kilo@@ her@@ tz , or 17@@ 60 .
The w@@ av@@ el@@ ength was 0.@@ 2 meters .
Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) 1.@@ 7@@ 6 times 0.@@ 2 over here is 3@@ 52 meters per second .
If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 43 .
But , here with k@@ lu@@ d@@ gy material , and l@@ ousy drink — we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to — not bad . P@@ ret@@ ty good .
All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
It was 197@@ 1 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m studying physics : L@@ and@@ au , Li@@ p@@ sch@@ it@@ z , Res@@ n@@ ick and H@@ alli@@ day .
I &apos;m going home for a mid@@ term . A ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on campus .
There &apos;s a ri@@ ot ! Hey , El@@ mo &apos;s done : off .
There &apos;s a ri@@ ot going on on campus , and the police are ch@@ asing me , right ?
I &apos;m walking across campus . Co@@ p comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
P@@ ul@@ ls out a gun . Go@@ es boom !
And a t@@ ear gas can@@ ister the size of a Pe@@ p@@ si can goes by my head . Wh@@ o@@ os@@ h !
I get a breath of t@@ ear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
This co@@ p comes after me with a ri@@ f@@ le .
He wants to cl@@ unk me over the head !
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot; &quot; I go running across campus quick as I can . I duc@@ k into H@@ ay@@ es Hall .
It &apos;s one of these b@@ ell@@ -@@ tower buildings .
The co@@ p &apos;s ch@@ asing me .
Ch@@ asing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
Ch@@ ases me into this room .
The entr@@ an@@ ce@@ way to the b@@ ell tower .
I sl@@ am the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pend@@ ul@@ um tic@@ king .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is propor@@ tional to its period . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I keep climbing up , go back .
I go to a place where a dow@@ el spl@@ its off .
There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
I &apos;m thinking of L@@ or@@ en@@ z contr@@ actions and E@@ inst@@ e@@ in@@ ian rel@@ ativity .
I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this woo@@ den l@@ ad@@ der .
I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ po@@ la .
A d@@ ome , one of these ten@@ -@@ foot dom@@ es .
I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cop@@ s bas@@ h@@ ing students &apos; heads , shooting t@@ ear gas , and watching students throwing bric@@ ks .
And I &apos;m asking , &quot; &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
N@@ am@@ ely , that when they cast bel@@ ls , they write inscri@@ ptions on them .
So , I wi@@ pe the pigeon man@@ ure off one of the bel@@ ls , and I look at it .
I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; Why am I here ? &quot; &quot; So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscri@@ bed upon the H@@ ay@@ es Hall tower bel@@ ls : &quot; &quot; All truth is one .
In this light , may science and religion end@@ e@@ avor here for the stea@@ dy evolution of man@@ kind , from darkness to light , from n@@ arro@@ w@@ ness to broad@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ dness , from pre@@ judi@@ ce to toler@@ ance .
It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked ti@@ ght .
Now , I &apos;m a neuro@@ scientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain per@@ forms under stress .
It rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ sol that rai@@ ses your heart rate , it mod@@ ul@@ ates ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine levels and it clouds your thinking .
I was having dinner with my colleague , Danny K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an , the Nobel Prize win@@ ner , and I somewhat emb@@ arr@@ asse@@ dly told him about having broken my window , and , you know , forgotten my pass@@ port , and Danny shared with me that he &apos;d been practic@@ ing something called pro@@ spec@@ tive h@@ ind@@ sight .
Well , in the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minim@@ ize the damage .
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
Ar@@ ound the home , design@@ ate a place for things that are easily lost .
Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ ppo@@ campus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the loc@@ ations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tri@@ bes live .
The hi@@ ppo@@ campus is the part of the brain that in London tax@@ ic@@ ab drivers becomes en@@ larg@@ ed .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squ@@ ir@@ rels to find their nuts .
They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hi@@ ppo@@ campus , this ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and pass@@ ports .
So in the home , design@@ ate a spot for your keys — a ho@@ ok by the door , maybe a dec@@ or@@ ative bo@@ wl .
For your pass@@ port , a particular dra@@ wer .
For your reading glasses , a particular table .
If you design@@ ate a spot and you &apos;re s@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
What about travel ?
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your pass@@ port , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud .
Now these are some rather obvious things .
Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ sol .
Cor@@ ti@@ sol is toxic , and it causes clou@@ dy thinking .
So part of the practice of the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your chol@@ ester@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
Now , you all know that high chol@@ ester@@ ol is associated with an increased risk of cardi@@ o@@ vas@@ cular disease , heart attack , stroke .
Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or under@@ go a surgery or any medical proce@@ dure before one person is helped .
We haven &apos;t figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescri@@ bed stati@@ n , what do you suppose it is ?
I ran through the numbers myself .
So for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be har@@ med by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pulled this number out of the air for shock value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typical , this number needed to treat .
For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mo@@ val of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 4@@ 9 .
That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ ger@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
They include im@@ pot@@ ence , er@@ ec@@ tile dys@@ function , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ tal t@@ earing , f@@ ec@@ al in@@ contin@@ ence .
And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
So the idea of the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to manu@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the spot .
And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
Unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as Danny K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an and his colleagues have shown .
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
I think the important point here is recogni@@ zing that all of us are fl@@ aw@@ ed .
We all are going to fail now and then .
The idea is to think ahead to what those failu@@ res might be , to put systems in place that will help minim@@ ize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
G@@ etting back to that s@@ now@@ y night in Mon@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my trip , I had my contr@@ actor inst@@ all a combination lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combination .
And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
He looked at me strang@@ ely , thinking that he mis@@ heard .
&quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wai@@ ter .
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
I &apos;m den@@ ied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
How did we get here ?
Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intell@@ ect and all my memories ?
Should I forget everything I learned in Arab@@ ic , just to con@@ form ?
D@@ esp@@ ite all that , I tried to understand him .
So , when he started writing in English , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The Ger@@ mans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clu@@ eless consumers , like we are most of the time .
L@@ angu@@ age isn &apos;t just for convers@@ ing , just words coming out of our mou@@ ths .
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Fre@@ e@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , in@@ dependence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; D@@ ad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) slogan ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in v@@ ain .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
I have a fr@@ anc@@ oph@@ one friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
I asked her once how things were going .
Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
The who and the why are what &apos;s important to me .
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
I want to know how I impact them .
I want to know how they impact me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s boun@@ ty for their living .
Un@@ der@@ standing all of this enables us to shift our perception of sea@@ food away from a commod@@ ity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
It allows for us to celebrate the sea@@ food that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
So what do we call this ?
I think we call it rest@@ or@@ ative sea@@ food .
Where sustainability is the capacity to end@@ ure and maintain , rest@@ or@@ ative is the ability to repl@@ en@@ ish and progress .
R@@ est@@ or@@ ative sea@@ food allows for an evol@@ ving and dynamic system and ac@@ knowle@@ dges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to repl@@ en@@ ish the ocean and to encourage its res@@ ili@@ ency .
It is a more hop@@ eful , it is a more human , and is a more useful way of understanding our environment .
W@@ all@@ et gu@@ ides — standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world — are very hand@@ y ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
Green , yellow and red l@@ ists &#91; of &#93; sea@@ food species .
The association is very easy : buy green , don &apos;t buy red , think twice about yellow .
But in my mind , it &apos;s really not enough to just eat green list .
We can &apos;t sust@@ ain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red .
But what if we eat only in the green list ?
You &apos;ve got po@@ le-@@ caught yel@@ low@@ fin tuna here — comes from sustainable stoc@@ ks .
Pole caught — no by@@ catch .
Great for fish@@ er@@ men . L@@ ots of money . Sup@@ porting local economies .
But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predat@@ or .
What &apos;s the context of this meal ?
Am I sitting down in a stea@@ k@@ house to a 16@@ -@@ oun@@ ce portion of this ?
Do I do this three times a week ?
I might still be in the green list , but I &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any fav@@ ors .
The point is that we have to have a context , a gau@@ ge for our actions in all this .
Ex@@ am@@ ple : I &apos;ve heard that red wine is great for my health — anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ants and min@@ er@@ als — heart healthy .
That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
I &apos;m going to drink so much of it . I &apos;m going to be so healthy .
Well , how many bot@@ tles is it before you tell me that I have a problem ?
Well folks , we have a protein problem .
We have lost this sensi@@ bility when it regar@@ ds our food , and we are paying a cost .
The problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost bene@@ ath the waves .
We are hi@@ ding that cost behind the social accep@@ tance of expanding wai@@ st@@ lines .
And we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster profits .
So the first thing about this idea of rest@@ or@@ ative sea@@ food is that it really takes into account our needs .
R@@ est@@ or@@ ative sea@@ food might best be represented not by Ja@@ ws , or by F@@ li@@ pper , or the G@@ or@@ don &apos;s fish@@ er@@ man , but rather , by the J@@ ol@@ ly Green Gi@@ ant .
V@@ eg@@ et@@ ables : they might yet save the oceans .
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
Well I &apos;d like to respect@@ fully sub@@ mit that bro@@ c@@ col@@ i green might then be the new blue .
We must continue to eat the best sea@@ food possible , if at all .
But we also must eat it with a ton of veget@@ ables .
The best part about rest@@ or@@ ative sea@@ food though is that it comes on the half-@@ shell with a bottle of T@@ ab@@ as@@ co and lem@@ on we@@ dges .
It comes in a five-@@ oun@@ ce portion of til@@ ap@@ ia bre@@ aded with Di@@ j@@ on mu@@ st@@ ard and cris@@ p@@ y , bro@@ iled bre@@ ad@@ cr@@ um@@ bs and a ste@@ aming pile of pec@@ an qu@@ ino@@ a pil@@ a@@ f with cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y , gr@@ illed bro@@ c@@ col@@ i so soft and sweet and char@@ red and smo@@ ky on the outside with just a h@@ int of chil@@ i fl@@ ake .
Wh@@ oo@@ o !
This is an easy sell .
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Wal@@ mart .
Jam@@ ie O@@ liver is campaig@@ ning to save America from the way we eat .
Sylvia is campaig@@ ning to save the oceans from the way we eat .
There &apos;s a pattern here .
For@@ get nuclear ho@@ loc@@ au@@ st ; it &apos;s the for@@ k that we have to worry about .
We have rav@@ aged our Earth and then used the food that we &apos;ve sourc@@ ed to handic@@ ap ourselves in more ways than one .
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
And so I think it &apos;s time we change what we expect from our food .
Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand .
So let &apos;s start there .
There &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
Dan Bar@@ ber and A@@ lice Wat@@ ers are leading pas@@ sion@@ ately the green food Del@@ icious Revolution .
But green foods often represent a way for us to dis@@ regard the responsibility as e@@ at@@ ers .
Just because it comes from a green source doesn &apos;t mean we can treat it with dis@@ regard on the plate .
We have ec@@ o-@@ friendly shrimp .
We can make them ; we have that technology .
But we can never have any ec@@ o-@@ friendly all-@@ you@@ -@@ can@@ -@@ eat shrimp buff@@ et .
It doesn &apos;t work .
H@@ ear@@ t-@@ healthy dinner is a very important part of rest@@ or@@ ative sea@@ food .
While we try to manage dec@@ lin@@ ing marine populations , the media &apos;s recomm@@ ending increased consumption of sea@@ food .
Stu@@ dies say that tens of thousands of American grand@@ mothers , grand@@ fathers , mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more sea@@ food .
That &apos;s a reward I am not willing to pass up .
But it &apos;s not all about the sea@@ food .
It &apos;s about the way that we look at our pl@@ ates .
As a chef , I realize the eas@@ iest thing for me to do is reduce the portion si@@ zes on my plate .
A couple things happened .
I made more money .
People started buying ap@@ peti@@ z@@ ers and sal@@ ads , because they knew they weren &apos;t going to fill up on the entre@@ es alone .
People spent more time engaging in their me@@ als , engaging with each other over their me@@ als .
People got , in short , more of what they came there for even though they got less protein .
They got more calories over the course of a diver@@ si@@ fied meal .
They got health@@ ier . I made more money .
This is great .
Envir@@ on@@ mental consider@@ ation was served with every plate , but it was served with a he@@ ap@@ ing m@@ ound of consider@@ ation for human interests at the same time .
One of the other things we did was begin to diver@@ si@@ fy the species that we served — small sil@@ ver@@ fish , an@@ cho@@ vies , m@@ ack@@ er@@ el , s@@ ar@@ din@@ es were un@@ common .
S@@ hel@@ l@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , oy@@ sters , cl@@ ams , til@@ ap@@ ia , ch@@ ar — these were the common species .
We were direc@@ ting tas@@ tes towards more res@@ ilience , more rest@@ or@@ ative options .
This is what we need to favor .
This is what the green list says .
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
But what of those big predat@@ ors , those fashi@@ on@@ able species , that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier ?
Well , if you must , I have a reci@@ pe for you .
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean , so here we go .
St@@ art with a 16@@ -@@ oun@@ ce portion of big fish .
Get a knife . C@@ ut it into four por@@ tions .
P@@ ut it on four pl@@ ates .
M@@ ound up those four pl@@ ates with veget@@ ables and then open up the very best bottle of Bur@@ g@@ un@@ dy you have , light the cand@@ les and celebrate it .
Cel@@ ebr@@ ate the opportunity you have to eat this .
In@@ vite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
I expect a lot from food .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
I expect that producing ingredients , preparing dis@@ hes and eating me@@ als is all part of the communi@@ on of human interests .
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
And he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents .
I remember well the me@@ als of my childhood .
They were reasonable por@@ tions of protein served with cop@@ ious quanti@@ ties of veget@@ ables and small amounts of star@@ ch , usually rice .
This is still how I largely eat today .
I get sick when I go to stea@@ k@@ houses .
I get the meat swe@@ ats .
It &apos;s like a han@@ go@@ ver from protein .
It &apos;s disgu@@ sting .
But of all the dire news that you &apos;ll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans , I have the un@@ fortunate burden of deli@@ vering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right .
E@@ at your veget@@ ables .
It &apos;s pretty strai@@ ght@@ forward .
So what are we looking for in a meal ?
Well for health , I &apos;m looking for wh@@ ol@@ esome ingredients that are good for my body .
For joy , I &apos;m looking for but@@ ter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like pen@@ ance .
For family , I &apos;m looking for re@@ cip@@ es that genu@@ fl@@ ect to my own personal hist@@ ories .
For community though , we start at the very beginning .
There &apos;s no es@@ cap@@ ing the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minim@@ ize it .
We &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
But it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global ge@@ ography of the communi@@ on we call dinner .
So if we all take only what we need , then we can begin to share the rest , we can begin to celebrate , we can begin to restore .
We need to sav@@ or veget@@ ables .
We need to sav@@ or smaller por@@ tions of sea@@ food .
And we need to save dinner .
Thank you .

Hi . I am an architect .
I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this car@@ d@@ board tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
198@@ 6 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to water@@ proof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fire@@ proof .
Then I built the tempor@@ ary structure , 1990 .
This is the first tempor@@ ary building made out of paper .
There are 3@@ 30 tubes , diam@@ eter 55 &#91; centi@@ meters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diam@@ eter of 120 centi@@ meters , or four feet , wide .
As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can t@@ ear off the inside of the wall . ( Laughter ) So it &apos;s very useful .
Y@@ ear 2000 , there was a big exp@@ o in Germany .
I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the exp@@ o was environmental issues .
So I was chosen to build the pav@@ il@@ ion out of paper tubes , recycl@@ able paper .
My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s complet@@ ed .
My goal was when the building was dem@@ ol@@ ished , because each country makes a lot of pav@@ il@@ ions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be re@@ used or recycl@@ ed .
After , the building was recycl@@ ed .
So that was the goal of my design .
Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in France in the city of Met@@ z .
Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in Paris by ourselves .
So we brought the paper tubes and the woo@@ den jo@@ ints to complete the 3@@ 5@@ -@@ met@@ er-@@ long office .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you . I had one big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
That was the problem .
Then I complet@@ ed the P@@ om@@ pi@@ d@@ ou Center in Met@@ z .
It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big mon@@ u@@ ment for the government .
But then I was very disap@@ pointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privil@@ eg@@ ed people , rich people , government , develop@@ ers .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
So they hire us to visu@@ alize their power and money by making mon@@ ument@@ al architecture .
That is our profession , even histor@@ ically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
So I was very disap@@ pointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
But I must say they are no longer natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
For example , earthqu@@ akes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
Then people need some tempor@@ ary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privil@@ eg@@ ed people .
So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of tempor@@ ary housing .
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
Two tri@@ bes , Hu@@ tu and Tu@@ t@@ si , fought each other .
Over two million people became refugees .
But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
They &apos;re so poor , and they are free@@ zing with blan@@ kets during the rain@@ y season , In the shel@@ ters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
But over two million people cut trees .
It just became big , heavy de@@ forestation and an environmental problem .
That is why they started providing alumin@@ um pi@@ pes , alumin@@ um barr@@ acks .
Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
So I pro@@ posed my idea to improve the situation using these recycl@@ ed paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
We built 50 units to do that as a monit@@ oring test for the dur@@ ability and mo@@ is@@ ture and ter@@ m@@ ites , so on .
And then , year after@@ ward , 1995 , in Ko@@ be , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
N@@ early 7@@ ,000 people were killed , and the city like this N@@ ag@@ ata district , all the city was bur@@ ned in a fire after the earthquake .
And also I found out there &apos;s many Viet@@ nam@@ ese refugees suffering and gathering at a Ca@@ tho@@ lic church — all the building was totally destroyed .
So I went there and also I pro@@ posed to the pri@@ ests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
After a fire , what are you propos@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; So he never tru@@ sted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started comm@@ u@@ ting to Ko@@ be , and I met the society of Viet@@ nam@@ ese people .
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
So I pro@@ posed to rebuild . I raised — did fun@@ d@@ raising .
I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to dem@@ ol@@ ish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
I asked the K@@ ir@@ in beer company to propose , because at that time , the A@@ sa@@ hi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
The color coordination is very important .
And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer cr@@ ate , but it came empty . ( Laughter ) So I remember it was so disap@@ pointing .
So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shel@@ ters .
Finally the pri@@ est , finally he tru@@ sted me to rebuild .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot; &quot; So we spent five weeks re@@ building the church .
It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
Then , in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an , they had a big earthquake , and we pro@@ posed to don@@ ate this church , so we dis@@ man@@ tled them , we sent them over to be built by volunte@@ er people .
It stayed there in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an as a permanent church even now .
So this building became a permanent building .
Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a tempor@@ ary building ?
Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
Even a concrete building can be very tempor@@ ary if that is made to make money .
In 1999 , in Tur@@ key , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
In 2004 , in S@@ ri L@@ an@@ ka , after the Su@@ ma@@ tra earthquake and tsunami , I re@@ built Islamic fish@@ er@@ men &apos;s villages .
And in 2008 , in Ch@@ eng@@ du , Si@@ chu@@ an area in China , nearly 7@@ 0,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contr@@ actor .
I was asked to rebuild the tempor@@ ary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
In one month , we complet@@ ed nine class@@ rooms , over 500 square meters .
It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ ila , also they had a big earthquake .
And this is a very interesting photo : former Pri@@ me Min@@ ister Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i and Japanese former former former former Pri@@ me Min@@ ister Mr. A@@ so — you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
And they are very kind , aff@@ or@@ ding my model .
I pro@@ posed a big re@@ building , a tempor@@ ary music hall , because L &apos;@@ A@@ qu@@ ila is very famous for music and all the concert h@@ alls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
So I pro@@ posed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the tempor@@ ary audit@@ orium .
He said , &quot; &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot; &quot; And I was very lucky .
Mr. Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i brought G@@ 8 sum@@ mit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euro@@ s from the Japanese government to rebuild this tempor@@ ary audit@@ orium .
Y@@ ear 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to San@@ to D@@ omin@@ go , n@@ ex@@ t-@@ door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in San@@ to D@@ omin@@ go to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated in a big room like a gy@@ m@@ nas@@ ium .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suffer mentally and physically .
So we went there to build parti@@ tions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the cur@@ tain .
However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government sing@@ le-@@ story housing like this one .
Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the tempor@@ ary housing , so dense and so mess@@ y because there is no stor@@ age , nothing , water is lea@@ king , so I thought , we have to make multi-@@ story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
So I pro@@ posed to the mayor while I was making parti@@ tions .
Finally I met a very nice mayor in On@@ ag@@ aw@@ a village in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
He asked me to build three-@@ story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
I used the shi@@ pping cont@@ ainer and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
Many of the people want to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I am working in New Ze@@ al@@ and , Christ@@ church .
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al of the city , the symbol of Christ@@ church , was totally destroyed .
And I was asked to come to rebuild the tempor@@ ary ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al .
So this is under construction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building mon@@ uments that are bel@@ o@@ ved by people .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psycho@@ logists , would have said that this baby was ir@@ rational , il@@ logical , e@@ go@@ cen@@ tric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture .
So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you just one example of this .
One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
After all , one of the things that &apos;s hard@@ est for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
And maybe the hard@@ est thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
Any@@ one who &apos;s followed politics can testi@@ fy to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
Bab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness mon@@ ologue about po@@ nies and birth@@ days and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
What we did — Bet@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ wl of raw bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ wl of del@@ icious gol@@ d@@ fish cr@@ ack@@ ers .
Now all of the babies , even in Ber@@ k@@ ley , like the cr@@ ack@@ ers and don &apos;t like the raw bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
( Laughter ) But then what Bet@@ ty did was to take a little taste of food from each bo@@ wl .
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
So half the time , she acted as if she liked the cr@@ ack@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a baby and any other sane person .
But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ mm , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
I tas@@ ted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ mm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ack@@ ers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck , cr@@ ack@@ ers .
I tas@@ ted the cr@@ ack@@ ers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
We did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies .
And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the cr@@ ack@@ ers if she liked the cr@@ ack@@ ers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she liked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
On the other hand , 15 mon@@ th-@@ olds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ack@@ ers , what they thought everybody must like .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
The first one is that these little 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
Even more remark@@ ably though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th-@@ olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 mon@@ th-@@ olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstr@@ ated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at babies super@@ fici@@ ally , they seem pretty us@@ eless .
And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than us@@ eless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of us@@ eless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ ang@@ ar@@ o@@ os and w@@ omb@@ ats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ birds for this idea are the birds up there .
On one side is a New Cal@@ ed@@ on@@ ian cro@@ w .
And cro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ d@@ ae , rav@@ ens , ro@@ o@@ ks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some resp@@ ects .
And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
And ch@@ ick@@ ens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ keys are basically as dum@@ b as dum@@ ps .
So they &apos;re very , very good at pec@@ king for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
Well it turns out that the babies , the New Cal@@ ed@@ on@@ ian cro@@ w babies , are fle@@ d@@ gl@@ ings .
They depend on their mom@@ s to drop worms in their little open mou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
Wh@@ ereas the ch@@ ick@@ ens are actually mature within a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason why the cro@@ ws end up on the cover of Science and the ch@@ ick@@ ens end up in the sou@@ p pot .
There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well .
So they seem to be beauti@@ fully su@@ ited to pec@@ king grain in one environment .
Other creatures , like the cro@@ ws , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the cro@@ ws .
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migr@@ ated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still po@@ pping those worms into those little open mou@@ ths .
All right , why would we see this cor@@ relation ?
Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big dis@@ advantage .
And that one big dis@@ advantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be hel@@ pl@@ ess .
So you don &apos;t want to have the mas@@ to@@ don charg@@ ing at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A sl@@ ing@@ shot or maybe a sp@@ ear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
You want to know all that before the mas@@ to@@ dons actually show up .
And the way the evolu@@ tions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like def@@ ective grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental stage of the same species — kind of like cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ars and but@@ ter@@ flies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant but@@ ter@@ flies who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ars who are in@@ ching along our narrow , grow@@ n@@ up , adult path .
If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the R@@ ever@@ end Thomas B@@ ay@@ es , who was a stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and mathematici@@ an in the 18@@ th century .
And essentially what B@@ ay@@ es did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to character@@ ize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
So what scientists do is they have a hypo@@ thesis that they think might be likely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypo@@ thesis .
Then they test that new hypo@@ thesis and so on and so forth .
And what B@@ ay@@ es showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
This is R@@ ever@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s not@@ e@@ book .
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calcul@@ ations with condi@@ tional prob@@ abilities that they &apos;re re@@ vis@@ ing to figure out how the world works .
All right , now that might seem like an even t@@ aller order to actually demonstrate .
Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ lic@@ ket D@@ et@@ ector .
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
Let me mention just one that we did with Tu@@ mar K@@ ush@@ ner , my student .
If I showed you this det@@ ector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the det@@ ector go would be to put a block on top of the det@@ ector .
But actually , this det@@ ector works in a bit of a strange way .
Because if you wave a block over the top of the det@@ ector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the det@@ ector will actually activ@@ ate two out of three times .
Wh@@ ereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the det@@ ector , it will only activ@@ ate two out of six times .
So the unlikely hypo@@ thesis actually has stronger evidence .
It looks as if the w@@ aving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the det@@ ector .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calcul@@ ations that will give them a condi@@ tional probability measure .
And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypo@@ thesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypo@@ thesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
Here &apos;s one from Cr@@ ist@@ ine Le@@ g@@ are &apos;s lab .
What Cr@@ ist@@ ine did was use our B@@ lic@@ ket D@@ et@@ ectors .
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anom@@ al@@ y .
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypo@@ thes@@ es in the space of two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : How about this ?
S@@ ame as the other side .
Al@@ ison G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : Okay , so his first hypo@@ thesis has just been fal@@ si@@ fied .
( Laughter ) Boy : This one ligh@@ ted up , and this one nothing .
A@@ G : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental not@@ e@@ book out .
Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : Every scientist will recognize that expression of des@@ pair .
( Laughter ) Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
A@@ G : Okay , hypo@@ thesis two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
He told the experim@@ enter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
Not working either .
Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
A@@ G : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypo@@ thesis .
Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
A@@ G : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypo@@ thesis .
Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly ador@@ able and articul@@ ate little boy , but what Cr@@ ist@@ ine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant but@@ ter@@ flies who can test five hypo@@ thes@@ es in two minutes ?
Well , if you go back to those psycho@@ logists and philosoph@@ ers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
And I think just the opposite is true .
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spo@@ t@@ light .
So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attend@@ ing to becomes extremely bright and vivi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dark .
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
So what happens when we pay attention is that the pre@@ frontal cortex , the sort of execu@@ tive part of our brains , s@@ ends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shu@@ ts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
So we have a very focused , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ driven kind of attention .
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lan@@ tern of consciousness than a spo@@ t@@ light of consciousness .
So babies and young children are very bad at n@@ arro@@ wing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re floo@@ ded with these neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ mit@@ ters that are really good at in@@ ducing learning and plas@@ tic@@ ity , and the inhi@@ bit@@ ory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those but@@ ter@@ flies who are designed to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contr@@ acts , it exp@@ ands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , facul@@ ty me@@ et@@ ing-@@ attend@@ ing z@@ om@@ bie back home .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking down@@ stairs , actually mim@@ ics the effect of those baby neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ mit@@ ters .
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-@@ espr@@ ess@@ os .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you w@@ aking up crying at three o &apos;@@ clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like tie our sho@@ el@@ aces and cross the street by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
But if what we want is to be like those but@@ ter@@ flies , to have open-@@ min@@ de@@ dness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaig@@ ner .
And this is the name of my campaign : S@@ I@@ N@@ G Cam@@ paig@@ n .
In No@@ vember of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela &apos;s 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 64 Foundation — that is his HIV / AIDS foundation .
And 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 64 is the number that Mandela had when he was im@@ pris@@ oned in Rob@@ b@@ en Island .
And that &apos;s me with You@@ ss@@ ou N &apos;@@ D@@ our , on@@ stage , having the time of my life .
The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Rob@@ b@@ en Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
You can see the bars of the window there .
It was quite a moment@@ ous occasion for all of us .
In that moment in time , Mandela told the world &apos;s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post-@@ ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id R@@ ain@@ bow N@@ ation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I hadn &apos;t realized that the HIV / AIDS pandem@@ ic was directly aff@@ ecting women in such a way .
And so I committed — when I left South Africa , when I left Cap@@ etown , I told myself , &quot; &quot; This is going to be something that I have to talk about .
I have to serve . &quot; &quot; And so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently I particip@@ ated in every single 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 64 event that I could take part in and gave news con@@ fer@@ ences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musici@@ an , with my commitment to Mandela — out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
Everyone in the world resp@@ ects Nelson Mandela , everyone rever@@ es Nelson Mandela .
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest in@@ cidents of transmission of the virus ?
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shoc@@ ked .
I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Z@@ ack@@ ie A@@ ch@@ m@@ at , the f@@ oun@@ der of Tre@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Cam@@ paig@@ n , an incredible campaig@@ ner and activis@@ t .
I met him at a 4@@ 6@@ 6@@ 64 event .
He was wearing a t-@@ shirt like the one I wear now .
This is a tool — this tells you I am in soli@@ dar@@ ity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV .
And in a way because of the stig@@ ma , by wearing this t-@@ shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes , we can talk about this issue .
It doesn &apos;t have to be in the clo@@ set . &quot; &quot; I became a member of Tre@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Cam@@ paig@@ n and I &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
It &apos;s a grass@@ roots campaign with 80 percent mem@@ ber@@ ship being women , most of whom are HI@@ V@@ -@@ positive .
They work in the field .
They have tremendous ou@@ tre@@ ach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
They have education programs .
They bring out the issues of stig@@ ma .
It &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
And yes , my S@@ I@@ N@@ G Cam@@ paig@@ n has supported Tre@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Cam@@ paig@@ n in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Tre@@ at@@ ment Ac@@ tion Cam@@ paig@@ n and the incredible work that they do , and are still continu@@ ing to do in South Africa .
So this is my S@@ I@@ N@@ G Cam@@ paig@@ n .
S@@ I@@ N@@ G Cam@@ paig@@ n is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
I &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years — I went to about 12 different countries .
Here I am in O@@ sl@@ o in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money .
In Joh@@ ann@@ es@@ burg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , midd@@ le-@@ class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tend@@ ing to avoid , because they are fati@@ gu@@ ed , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
A@@ ar@@ on Mot@@ so@@ al@@ ed@@ i , the current health minister , attend@@ ed that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
This is in the Scot@@ tish Par@@ li@@ ament .
I &apos;ve sub@@ sequ@@ ently become an en@@ vo@@ y for Scot@@ land and HIV .
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
And once again , in E@@ din@@ bur@@ gh with the wonderful African Children &apos;s Ch@@ oir who I simply adore .
And it &apos;s children like this , many of whom have been orph@@ an@@ ed because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus .
I &apos;m sitting here in New York with Mich@@ el Si@@ di@@ be — he &apos;s the director of U@@ NA@@ IDS .
And I &apos;m very hon@@ ored by the fact that Mich@@ el invited me , only a few months ago , to become a U@@ NA@@ IDS ambass@@ ad@@ or .
And in this way , I &apos;ve been str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening my platform and broad@@ ening my ou@@ tre@@ ach .
The message that U@@ NA@@ IDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elim@@ ination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 .
It &apos;s a very ambi@@ tious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
This can happen .
And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we &apos;re smil@@ ing , both of us are smil@@ ing , because we &apos;re very confident , because we know that that young woman is rece@@ iving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she &apos;s about to give birth to .
And her baby will receive P@@ M@@ T@@ C@@ T , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
Now that is pre@@ vention at the very beginning of life .
It &apos;s one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandem@@ ic .
Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Av@@ eli@@ le .
This is Av@@ eli@@ le — she goes with me wherever I go .
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orph@@ ans .
Av@@ eli@@ le &apos;s mother had HIV virus — she died from A@@ ID@@ S@@ -@@ related illness .
Av@@ eli@@ le had the virus , she was born with the virus .
And here she is at seven years old , weigh@@ ing no more than a one year-old baby .
At this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-@@ blo@@ wn AIDS and had pneu@@ mon@@ ia .
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern C@@ ape and spent a whole afternoon with her — an ador@@ able child .
The doctors and nurses were phenomen@@ al .
They put her on very special nutri@@ tious diet and took great care of her .
And we didn &apos;t know when we left the hospital — because we fil@@ med her story — we didn &apos;t know if she was going to survive .
So , it was obviously — it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very reson@@ ant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Av@@ eli@@ le again .
And I &apos;m getting — the hai@@ rs on my — I don &apos;t know if you can see the hai@@ rs on my arms .
They &apos;re standing up because I know what I &apos;m going to show you .
This is the transformation that took place .
Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
( Applause ) That round of appl@@ ause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Av@@ eli@@ le .
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the M@@ ill@@ enni@@ um Develop@@ ment Go@@ als , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world — especially in sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa — could you please stand up .
I think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
Thank you very much .

Fif@@ ty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was sec@@ ret@@ ly moving a large object through a des@@ ol@@ ate coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to con@@ quer outer space .
The rocket was huge .
And p@@ acked in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
On October 4 , 195@@ 7 , they launched their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
In the ol@@ den days , explor@@ ers like V@@ as@@ co da G@@ ama and Colum@@ bus had the good fortune to open up the terres@@ trial globe .
Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
And it is for those in the future to env@@ y us our joy . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re watching sni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts from &quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , &quot; &quot; my fifth document@@ ary feature , which is just about complet@@ ed .
It tells the story of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
For days after the launch , S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was a wonderful curiosity .
A man@@ -@@ made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired a@@ we and pri@@ de that humans had finally launched an object into space .
But just three days later , on a day they called Red Mon@@ day , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k was proof that our enemy had be@@ aten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bomb@@ s , using their S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k rocket as an IBM missi@@ le .
All hell broke loo@@ se .
S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k quickly became one of the three great shoc@@ ks to hit America — histori@@ ans say the equal of P@@ ear@@ l Har@@ bor or 9 / 11 .
It provo@@ ked the missi@@ le gap .
It explo@@ ded an arms race .
It began the space race .
Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,@@ 200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
And the re@@ actions to S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k went far beyond weapons increases .
For example , some here will remember this day , June 195@@ 8 , the National Ci@@ vi@@ l De@@ fen@@ se Dr@@ ill , where tens of millions of people in 7@@ 8 cities went underground .
Or the G@@ all@@ up Pol@@ l that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
But S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k provo@@ ked wonderful changes as well .
For example , some in this room went to school on schol@@ ar@@ ship because of S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
Sup@@ port for engineering , math and science — education in general — bo@@ om@@ ed .
And V@@ int Cer@@ f points out that S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k led directly to AR@@ PA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
My feature document@@ ary shows how a free society can be stam@@ pe@@ ded by those who know how to use media .
But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
&quot; &quot; S@@ pu@@ t@@ ni@@ k &quot; &quot; will soon be released .
In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : long@@ time TED@@ ster , J@@ ay Wal@@ ker .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .

Thank you , Chris .
Good morning . So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
As a cyber@@ -@@ mag@@ ician , I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
You &apos;ve probably all heard of Google &apos;s Project Gl@@ ass .
It &apos;s new technology . You look through them and the world you see is augment@@ ed with data : names of places , mon@@ uments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
So these are my illusion glasses .
They &apos;re a little bigger . They &apos;re a prototype .
And when you look through them , you get a glim@@ pse into the mind of the cyber@@ -@@ illu@@ sion@@ ist .
Let me show you what I mean .
All we need is a playing card . Any card will do .
Like this . And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
All right . Very significant mark .
And let &apos;s put it back into the dec@@ k , somewhere in the middle , and let &apos;s get started .
( Music ) Voice : Sy@@ stem ready . Ac@@ qu@@ iring image .
Mar@@ co T@@ emp@@ est : For those of you who don &apos;t play cards , a dec@@ k of cards is made up of four different su@@ its : hearts , clubs , diam@@ onds and sp@@ ades .
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpre@@ ted in many different ways .
Now , some say that the four su@@ its represent the four seas@@ ons .
There &apos;s spring , summer , au@@ tum@@ n and â   Voice : My favorite season is w@@ inter@@ .@@ M@@ T : Well yeah , mine too .
Win@@ ter is like magic . It &apos;s a time of change , when warm@@ th turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all dis@@ appears .
There are 13 cards in each suit . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents a phase of the 13 lun@@ ar cycles .
M@@ T : So over here is low ti@@ de , and over here is high ti@@ de , and in the middle is the moon .
Voice : The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
M@@ T : There are two colors in a dec@@ k of cards .
There is the color red and the color black , repres@@ enting the constant change from day to night .
Voice : Mar@@ co , I did not know you could do that . ( Laughter ) M@@ T : And is it a co@@ incidence that there are 52 cards in a dec@@ k of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
( Music ) Voice : If you total all the spots on a dec@@ k of cards , the result is 3@@ 65 .
M@@ T : Oh , 3@@ 65 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
Make a wish . ( B@@ lowing noise ) Voice : Don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
M@@ T : Well , as a matter of fact , it was on my six@@ th birthday that I received my first dec@@ k of cards , and ever since that day , I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , hus@@ ban@@ ds and wi@@ ves , even kings and que@@ ens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who are these ? M@@ T : Ah , mis@@ chi@@ e@@ f-@@ makers . W@@ atch .
W@@ ake up .
Jo@@ ker : Wh@@ o@@ a@@ .@@ M@@ T : Are you ready for your party piece ?
Jo@@ ker : R@@ ea@@ dy ! M@@ T : Let me see what you &apos;ve got .
Jo@@ ker : Pres@@ enting my po@@ go stic@@ k@@ .@@ M@@ T : Ah . W@@ atch out .
Jo@@ ker : Wh@@ o@@ a , who@@ a , who@@ a , oh ! ( Music ) M@@ T : But today , I am performing for a different kind of audience .
I &apos;m performing for you .
Voice : S@@ ign@@ ed card det@@ ec@@ te@@ d@@ .@@ M@@ T : Well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a mag@@ ician ? Is it a 9@@ -to-@@ 5 job ?
Of course not ! You &apos;ve got to practice 24 / 7 .
I don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
24 / 7 is a little bit of an exag@@ ger@@ ation , but it does take practice . Now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil super@@ natural force . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Wh@@ o@@ a .
Well , to this , I just say , no no .
Actually , in German , it &apos;s ne@@ in ne@@ in . ( Laughter ) Mag@@ ic isn &apos;t that intense . I have to war@@ n you , though , if you ever play with someone who de@@ als cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
( Music ) Voice : Why not ? That &apos;s a very good hand .
The odds of getting it are 4,@@ 1@@ 65 to one .
M@@ T : Yeah , but I guess my hand is better . We beat the odds .
Voice : I think you got your birthday w@@ ish@@ .@@ M@@ T : And that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it .
And unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not@@ .@@ Voice : S@@ ign@@ ed card det@@ ected .
D@@ ig@@ ital M@@ T : This is without a question the real thing .
M@@ T : B@@ ye bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been at MIT for 44 years .
And the third is a little bit less obvious .
Have they all agreed ? No , not completely .
I have so much money , it takes me forever .
I grew up in Bi@@ h@@ ar , India &apos;s poorest state , and I remember when I was six years old , I remember coming home one day to find a car@@ t full of the most del@@ icious swe@@ ets at our do@@ or@@ step .
My brothers and I du@@ g in , and that &apos;s when my father came home .
He was li@@ vi@@ d , and I still remember how we cri@@ ed when that car@@ t with our half-@@ eaten swe@@ ets was pulled away from us .
L@@ ater , I understood why my father got so upset .
Those swe@@ ets were a bri@@ be from a contr@@ actor who was trying to get my father to aw@@ ard him a government contract .
My father was responsible for building roads in Bi@@ h@@ ar , and he had developed a firm st@@ ance against corruption , even though he was har@@ ass@@ ed and threatened .
His was a lon@@ ely struggle , because Bi@@ h@@ ar was also India &apos;s most corru@@ pt state , where public offici@@ als were en@@ ri@@ ching themselves , &#91; rather &#93; than serving the poor who had no means to express their angu@@ ish if their children had no food or no school@@ ing .
And I experienced this most vis@@ cer@@ ally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty .
And as I went village to village , I remember one day , when I was fam@@ ished and ex@@ hau@@ sted , and I was almost collap@@ sing in a scor@@ ching heat under a tree , and just at that time , one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his h@@ ut and gr@@ ac@@ i@@ ously fed me .
Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
This profound gift of gener@@ os@@ ity challeng@@ ed and changed the very purpose of my life .
I resol@@ ved to give back .
L@@ ater , I joined the World Bank , which sou@@ ght to fight such poverty by transfer@@ ring aid from rich to poor countries .
My initial work focused on Uganda , where I focused on negoti@@ ating re@@ forms with the Fin@@ ance Min@@ istry of Uganda so they could access our lo@@ ans .
But after we dis@@ bur@@ sed the lo@@ ans , I remember a trip in Uganda where I found new@@ ly built schools without text@@ books or teachers , new health clin@@ ics without drugs , and the poor once again without any voice or re@@ course .
It was Bi@@ h@@ ar all over again .
Bi@@ h@@ ar represents the challenge of development : ab@@ j@@ ect poverty surrounded by corruption .
Glob@@ ally , 1.@@ 3 billion people live on less than $ 1.@@ 25 a day , and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practic@@ ed since 194@@ 4 , when win@@ ners of World War II , 500 f@@ ounding fathers , and one lon@@ ely f@@ ounding mother , gather@@ ed in New H@@ amp@@ sh@@ ire , USA , to establ@@ ish the Bret@@ ton Woo@@ ds institutions , including the World Bank .
And that traditional approach to development had three key elements . First , transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to po@@ orer countries in the South , ac@@ compan@@ ied by reform prescri@@ ptions .
Second , the development institutions that chann@@ eled these transf@@ ers were op@@ aque , with little transparency of what they fin@@ anced or what results they achieved .
And third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government el@@ ites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate bene@@ fici@@ aries of development assistance .
Today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
O@@ pen knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shif@@ ts that are transform@@ ing development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witn@@ essed in Uganda and in Bi@@ h@@ ar .
The first key shift is open knowledge .
You know , developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S. , Europe or the World Bank .
They get their inspiration , their hope , their practical know@@ -@@ how , from successful emerging economies in the South .
They want to know how China lif@@ ted 500 million people out of poverty in 30 years , how Mexico &apos;s O@@ por@@ tu@@ ni@@ d@@ ades program improved school@@ ing and nutrition for millions of children .
This is the new ecosystem of open-@@ knowledge flows , not just traveling North to South , but South to South , and even South to North , with Mexico &apos;s O@@ por@@ tu@@ ni@@ d@@ ades today inspiring New York City .
And just as these Nor@@ th-@@ to-@@ South transf@@ ers are opening up , so too are the development institutions that chann@@ eled these transf@@ ers .
This is the second shift : open aid .
Rec@@ ently , the World Bank opened its v@@ ault of data for public use , rele@@ asing 8@@ ,000 economic and social indic@@ ators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crow@@ d@@ source innovative app@@ s using this data .
Develop@@ ment institutions today are also opening for public s@@ cru@@ tiny the projects they finance .
Take Ge@@ o@@ M@@ apping . In this map from Kenya , the red dots show where all the schools fin@@ anced by don@@ ors are located , and the dar@@ ker the sh@@ ade of green , the more the number of ou@@ t-@@ of-@@ school children .
So this simple mas@@ h@@ up reve@@ als that don@@ ors have not fin@@ anced any schools in the areas with the most ou@@ t-@@ of-@@ school children , provo@@ king new questions . Is development assistance targ@@ eting those who most need our help ?
In this man@@ ner , the World Bank has now Ge@@ o@@ M@@ apped 30,000 project activities in 14@@ 3 countries , and don@@ ors are using a common platform to map all their projects .
This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accoun@@ tability of aid .
And this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . Go@@ vern@@ ments today are opening up just as citizens are demand@@ ing voice and accoun@@ tability .
From the Arab Spr@@ ing to the An@@ na H@@ az@@ are movement in India , using mobile phones and social media not just for political accoun@@ tability but also for development accoun@@ tability .
Are governments deli@@ vering services to the citizens ?
So for instance , several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public .
But , you know , there is a big difference between a budget that &apos;s public and a budget that &apos;s accessible .
This is a public budget . ( Laughter ) And as you can see , it &apos;s not really accessible or underst@@ and@@ able to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources .
To tackle this problem , governments are using new tools to visu@@ alize the budget so it &apos;s more underst@@ and@@ able to the public .
In this map from Mol@@ do@@ va , the green color shows those distric@@ ts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
To@@ ols like this help turn a shelf full of ins@@ cru@@ table documents into a public@@ ly underst@@ and@@ able visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
So in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines today , parents and students can give real-@@ time feedback on a website , Ch@@ ec@@ k@@ my@@ school@@ .org , or using SMS , whether teachers and text@@ books are showing up in school , the same problems I witn@@ essed in Uganda and in Bi@@ h@@ ar .
And the government is respon@@ sive . So for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school re@@ pairs had st@@ all@@ ed due to corruption , the Department of E@@ ducation in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines took swi@@ ft action .
And you know what &apos;s exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South , from the Phili@@ pp@@ ines to Indon@@ esia , Kenya , Mol@@ do@@ va and beyond .
In D@@ ar es Sal@@ a@@ am , Tanzan@@ ia , even an im@@ pover@@ ished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations .
This is what the map of T@@ and@@ ale looked like in Au@@ gust , 2011 . But within a few weeks , university students were able to use mobile phones and an open-source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure .
And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working , aggre@@ g@@ ated in the red bubbles that you see , which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor .
Today , even Bi@@ h@@ ar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent , accessible and respon@@ sive to the poor .
But , you know , in many parts of the world , governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor , and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system .
These are the lon@@ ely w@@ arri@@ ors like my father and many , many others , and a key fronti@@ er of development work is to help these lon@@ ely w@@ arri@@ ors join hands so they can together overcome the odds .
So for instance , today , in Ghana , cour@@ age@@ ous re@@ form@@ ers from civil society , Par@@ li@@ ament and government , have for@@ ged a co@@ ali@@ tion for transparent contr@@ acts in the oil sector , and , gal@@ van@@ ized by this , re@@ form@@ ers in Par@@ li@@ ament are now investig@@ ating du@@ bi@@ ous contr@@ acts .
These examples give new hope , new possibility to the problems I witn@@ essed in Uganda or that my father confron@@ ted in Bi@@ h@@ ar .
Two years ago , on A@@ pr@@ il 8@@ th , 2010 , I called my father .
It was very late at night , and at age 80 , he was ty@@ ping a 7@@ 0-@@ page public interest li@@ ti@@ gation against corruption in a road project .
Th@@ ough he was no lawyer , he argu@@ ed the case in court himself the next day . He won the rul@@ ing , but later that very evening , he fell , and he died .
He fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government offici@@ als need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
These became the two boo@@ k@@ ends of his life , and the journey he traveled in between mir@@ ro@@ red the changing development landscape .
Today , I &apos;m inspired by these changes , and I &apos;m excited that at the World Bank , we are embrac@@ ing these new directions , a significant de@@ par@@ ture from my work in Uganda 20 years ago .
We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions , inspiring practi@@ tion@@ ers , so aid becomes transparent , accoun@@ table and effective , so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with re@@ form@@ ers in government .
We need to acceler@@ ate these shif@@ ts .
If we do , we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bi@@ h@@ ar , in Uganda , and beyond .
We will find that text@@ books and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
We will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
So imagine that a plane is about to crash with 250 children and babies , and if you knew how to stop that , would you ?
Now imagine that 60 planes full of babies under five crash every single day .
That &apos;s the number of kids that never make it to their fifth birthday .
6@@ .@@ 6 million children never make it to their fifth birthday .
Most of these deaths are prev@@ entable , and that doesn &apos;t just make me sad , it makes me angry , and it makes me determined .
H@@ and@@ washing with so@@ ap keeps kids in school .
It stops babies from dying .
H@@ and@@ washing with so@@ ap is one of the most co@@ st-@@ effective ways of saving children &apos;s lives .
It can save over 6@@ 00,000 children every year .
That &apos;s the equivalent of stop@@ ping 10 jum@@ bo j@@ ets full of babies and children from crash@@ ing every single day .
I think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
So now just take a minute .
All right , get to know each other .
They look really pretty .
All right .
So what if I told you that the person whose hands you just sho@@ ok actually didn &apos;t wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet ? ( Laughter ) They don &apos;t look so pretty anymore , right ?
P@@ ret@@ ty y@@ uc@@ ky , you would agree with me .
What is it ? Is there no so@@ ap ?
Actually , so@@ ap is available .
In 90 percent of house@@ holds in India , 9@@ 4 percent of house@@ holds in Kenya , you will find so@@ ap .
Even in countries where so@@ ap is the low@@ est , like Ethiopia , we are at 50 percent .
So why is it ?
Why aren &apos;t people washing their hands ?
Why is it that May@@ ank , this young boy that I met in India , isn &apos;t washing his hands ?
Well , in May@@ ank &apos;s family , so@@ ap is used for ba@@ thing , so@@ ap is used for laun@@ dry , so@@ ap is used for washing dis@@ hes .
His parents think sometimes it &apos;s a preci@@ ous commod@@ ity , so they &apos;ll keep it in a cu@@ p@@ board .
They &apos;ll keep it away from him so he doesn &apos;t waste it .
What &apos;s the result of that ?
Children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
Did you learn to wash your hands in school ?
Every second in Asia and Africa , 1@@ 11 mothers will buy this bar to protect their family .
It &apos;s that belief , plus the scale of Un@@ il@@ ever , that allows us to keep talking about hand@@ washing with so@@ ap and hygi@@ ene to these mothers .
Think about it : Mar@@ ket@@ e@@ ers spend all their time making us switch from one brand to the other .
And actually , they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages .
But it &apos;s been happening for centuries : the Li@@ fe@@ bu@@ o@@ y brand was launched in 18@@ 9@@ 4 in Vic@@ tori@@ an England to actually combat chol@@ era .
Last week , I was in Ghana with the minister of health , because if you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a chol@@ era out@@ break in Ghana at the moment .
A hundred and eigh@@ te@@ en years later , the solution is exactly the same : It &apos;s about en@@ sur@@ ing that they have access to this bar of so@@ ap , and that they &apos;re using it , because that &apos;s the number one way to actually stop chol@@ era from spreading .
I think this drive for profit is extremely powerful , sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government .
Go@@ vern@@ ment is doing what they can , especially in terms of the pandem@@ ics and epidem@@ ics such as chol@@ era , or E@@ bo@@ la at the moment , but with comp@@ eting pri@@ orities .
The budget is not always there .
In short , those that fight for public health are actually dependent upon the so@@ ap companies to keep prom@@ oting hand@@ washing with so@@ ap .
W@@ in for the public sector , because we help them reach their targets .
And most importantly , win for the most vulnerable .
Most of these discussions are still happening online .
I come from Mal@@ i , one of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
I trained in Europe &apos;s premier school of public health .
I think I &apos;m probably one of the only women in my country with this high degree in health , and the only one with a doctor@@ ate in hand@@ washing with so@@ ap .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) N@@ ine years ago , I decided , with a successful public health career in the making , that I could make the biggest impact coming , selling and prom@@ oting the world &apos;s best invention in public health : so@@ ap .
We &apos;ve reached over 18@@ 3 million people in 16 countries .
My team and I have the ambition to reach one billion by 2020 .
It may be uncomfortable for some to hear — business growth and lives saved somehow equ@@ ated in the same sentence — but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more .
Without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
Last week , my team and I spent time vis@@ iting mothers that have all experienced the same thing : the death of a new@@ born .
I &apos;m a mom . I can &apos;t imagine anything more powerful and more painful .
This one is from My@@ an@@ mar .
She had the most beautiful smile , the smile , I think , that life gives you when you &apos;ve had a second chance .
Her son , My@@ o , is her second one .
And that &apos;s what insp@@ ires me , insp@@ ires me to continue in this mission , to know that I can equi@@ p her with what &apos;s needed so that she can do the most beautiful job in the world : nur@@ tur@@ ing her new@@ born .
And next time you think of a gift for a new mom and her family , don &apos;t look far : buy her so@@ ap .
It &apos;s the most beautiful invention in public health .
These are simple objects : c@@ loc@@ ks , keys , comb@@ s , glasses .
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
During the four years of conflict that dev@@ ast@@ ated the Bos@@ ni@@ an nation in the early &apos; 90s , approxim@@ ately 30,000 citizens , mainly civ@@ ili@@ ans , went missing , pres@@ um@@ ed killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
The international criminal tribun@@ al delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
Gen@@ o@@ cide is a system@@ atic and deliber@@ ate destruction of a rac@@ ial , political , religious or ethni@@ c group .
As much as genocide is about killing .
It is also about destro@@ ying their property , their cultural her@@ itage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
Gen@@ o@@ cide is not only about the killing ; it is about the den@@ ied identity .
There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime .
There are always rem@@ n@@ ants of the per@@ ished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our sel@@ ective and f@@ ading memory of them .
Not a single body should remain un@@ discovered or un@@ identified .
Once re@@ covered , these it@@ ems that the victims carried with them on their way to exec@@ ution are carefully clean@@ ed , analy@@ zed , cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed and sto@@ red .
Sur@@ viv@@ ors are occasi@@ onally called to try to identify these it@@ ems physically , but physical brow@@ sing is extremely difficult , an in@@ effective and painful process .
Once the for@@ en@@ s@@ ics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become orph@@ ans of the narrative .
Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shel@@ ved , out of sight and out of mind .
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single ex@@ hum@@ ed it@@ em in order to create a visual arch@@ ive that surviv@@ ors could easily brow@@ se .
As a story@@ tel@@ ler , I like to give back to the community .
I like to move beyond raising awareness .
And in this case , someone may recognize these it@@ ems or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , un@@ bi@@ ased and accurate remin@@ der of what happened .
Phot@@ ography is about empathy , and the famili@@ arity of these it@@ ems guaran@@ tee empathy .
In this case , I am merely a tool , a for@@ en@@ sic , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
In all their simplicity , these it@@ ems are the last test@@ ament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent remin@@ der that these people ever existed .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
But that can &apos;t be right .
I am for chocolate don@@ u@@ ts .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
I would never have been that ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day challenges .
( Applause )
Hi . So today , I &apos;d like to share some works in progress .
So I &apos;m going to try and describe some of the experiences that we &apos;re looking for through each of the works .
So the first work is called the Im@@ per@@ ial Mon@@ o@@ chrom@@ es .
A viewer sort of un@@ suspec@@ t@@ ingly walks into the room , and cat@@ ches a glim@@ pse of these pan@@ els in a mess@@ y composition on the wall .
Within seconds , as if the pan@@ els have noticed the presence of the viewer , they appear to pan@@ ic and sort of get into a stric@@ t symmetry .
( Laughter ) So this is the sket@@ ch of the two states .
One is total chaos . The other is absolute order .
This also reminded us of two very different pic@@ t@@ orial traditions .
One is the al@@ tar tab@@ lets of the 15@@ th century , and the other is about 100 years ago , Mal@@ ev@@ ich &apos;s abstract com@@ positions .
So I &apos;m just going to take you to a video .
That &apos;s about this much . And the small@@ est one is an A@@ 4 .
So a viewer en@@ ters the space , and they sn@@ ap to attention .
So this brings me to a qui@@ eter , small work called H@@ and@@ held .
So this inst@@ ability in the movement very closely res@@ em@@ bles the un@@ stea@@ dy nature of images seen through a hand@@ held camera .
So here I &apos;m going to show you two tan@@ de@@ m clips .
So we &apos;ve just removed the camera and transfer@@ red that movement onto the panel .
So here &apos;s a video .
That sort of lik@@ ens it to the amount of str@@ ain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very del@@ ic@@ ately to the viewer in front of them .
The next work is D@@ eco@@ y .
It has a r@@ ounded body , two arms , and a very tall , hea@@ d-@@ like anten@@ na , and its so@@ le purpose is to attract attention towards itself .
So when a viewer passes by , it sort of til@@ ts from side to side , and moves its arms more and more fran@@ tically as the person gets closer .
So here is the first test scenario .
But the idea is that once it &apos;s got the person &apos;s attention , it &apos;s no longer interested , and it looks for the next person whose attention to get .
It appears to be mass@@ -@@ manufactu@@ red like it came out of a factory like vacu@@ um clean@@ ers and washing machines .
The next work is an object , that &apos;s also a kind of sound instrument .
In the shape of an amph@@ i@@ theater that &apos;s sc@@ aled to the size of an audience as perce@@ ived from somebody from the stage .
They &apos;re mechan@@ ically enabled to cl@@ ap of their own free will .
So when the viewer steps in front of the audience , there will be a response .
So there &apos;s a sense of jud@@ gment and ca@@ pr@@ ici@@ ousness and un@@ eas@@ iness involved .
It also has an all@@ ur@@ ing and tr@@ ap@@ -like quality to it .
So here if you see we &apos;re quite excited about the image of the head spl@@ itting to form the two hands .
So we can &apos;t wait to be eng@@ ul@@ fed by 9@@ 96 of them .
Okay , this is the last work . It &apos;s called the Fr@@ am@@ er@@ un@@ ners .
It comes out of the idea of a window .
This is an actual window in our studio , and as you can see , it &apos;s made up of three different th@@ ick@@ n@@ esses of woo@@ den sections .
So we used the same window vocab@@ ul@@ ary to construct our own frame or grid that &apos;s susp@@ ended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides .
This grid is in@@ hab@@ ited by a tri@@ be of small figures .
They &apos;re also made up of three different si@@ zes , as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain .
Each of these figures can also run back@@ ward and forward in the track and hide behind two ad@@ jac@@ ent tracks .
So in contrast to this very ti@@ ght grid , we wanted to give these figures a very com@@ ical and sl@@ ap@@ stic@@ k-@@ like quality , as if a pu@@ pp@@ et@@ e@@ er has taken them and physically anim@@ ated them down the path .
So we like the idea of these figures sort of ski@@ pping along like they &apos;re ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and care@@ free and happ@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ lucky and content , until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fas@@ test wall .
So to us , this work also pres@@ ents its own contradiction .
These figures are sort of entr@@ apped within this very strong grid , which is like a prison , but also a for@@ tr@@ ess , because it allows them to be ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous and n@@ ai@@ ve and care@@ free and quite ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of the extern@@ al world .
So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration , and we were very lucky to collabor@@ ate with E@@ T@@ H Z@@ ur@@ ich to develop the first prototype .
So you see they extr@@ acted the motion co@@ gs from our anim@@ ations and created a w@@ ig@@ gle that integrated the hea@@ d-@@ bo@@ b@@ bing movement and the back@@ -and-@@ forth movement .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
You can see it can fit into the pal@@ m of my hand .
So imagine our excit@@ ement when we saw it really working in the studio , and here it is .
( Laughter ) Thank you .
( Applause )
But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened .
Anyway , today I &apos;m a writ@@ er-@@ blo@@ gg@@ er guy .
here &apos;s my brain .
( Laughter ) There is a difference .
Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0-@@ year life .
So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that calend@@ ar .
We need to stay aware of the Inst@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
Some@@ time soon .
Thank you .
There &apos;s a man by the name of Cap@@ tain William Sw@@ en@@ son who recently was awar@@ ded the con@@ gr@@ essi@@ onal M@@ ed@@ al of Hon@@ or for his actions on September 8 , 2009 .
On that day , a colum@@ n of American and Afghan tro@@ ops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government offici@@ als , a group of Afghan government offici@@ als , who would be meeting with some local village el@@ ders .
The colum@@ n came under am@@ bus@@ h , and was surrounded on three sides , and amongst many other things , Cap@@ tain Sw@@ en@@ son was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the w@@ ounded and pull out the dead .
One of the people he res@@ cu@@ ed was a ser@@ geant , and he and a com@@ ra@@ de were making their way to a me@@ dev@@ ac helicop@@ ter .
And what was remarkable about this day is , by she@@ er co@@ incidence , one of the me@@ dev@@ ac medic@@ s happened to have a Go@@ Pr@@ o camera on his hel@@ met and captured the whole scene on camera .
It shows Cap@@ tain Sw@@ en@@ son and his com@@ ra@@ de bringing this w@@ ounded soldier who had received a g@@ un@@ shot to the neck .
They put him in the helicop@@ ter , and then you see Cap@@ tain Sw@@ en@@ son b@@ end over and give him a k@@ iss before he turns around to rescue more .
I saw this , and I thought to myself , where do people like that come from ?
What is that ? That is some deep , deep emotion , when you would want to do that .
There &apos;s a love there , and I wanted to know why is it that I don &apos;t have people that I work with like that ?
You know , in the military , they give med@@ als to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain .
In business , we give bon@@ uses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain .
We have it backwards . Right ?
So I asked myself , where do people like this come from ?
And my initial conclusion was that they &apos;re just better people .
That &apos;s why they &apos;re attr@@ acted to the military .
These better people are attr@@ acted to this concept of service .
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
What I learned was that it &apos;s the environment , and if you get the environment right , every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things , and more importantly , others have that capacity too .
I &apos;ve had the great honor of getting to meet some of these , who we would call heroes , who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it ?
Why did you do it ? &quot; &quot; And they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
It &apos;s this deep sense of trust and cooperation .
So trust and cooperation are really important here .
The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings , they are not instructions .
I can &apos;t simply say to you , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ust me , &quot; &quot; and you will .
I can &apos;t simply instruc@@ t two people to co@@ operate , and they will .
So where does that feeling come from ?
Nothing personal .
Whether it was the weather , lack of resources , maybe a s@@ ab@@ er-@@ to@@ oth@@ ed ti@@ ger , all of these things working to reduce our lif@@ esp@@ an .
And when we felt safe amongst our own , the natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
There are inher@@ ent benefits to this .
It means I can fall as@@ le@@ ep at night and trust that someone from within my tri@@ be will watch for danger .
B@@ ad system of survival .
The modern day is exactly the same thing .
The world is filled with danger , things that are trying to frustr@@ ate our lives or reduce our success , reduce our opportunity for success .
It could be the ups and dow@@ ns in the economy , the uncertainty of the stock market .
It could be a new technology that rend@@ ers your business model obsol@@ ete over@@ night .
Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you .
It &apos;s sometimes trying to put you out of business , but at the very minimum is working hard to frustr@@ ate your growth and steal your business from you .
We have no control over these forces .
These are a constant , and they &apos;re not going away .
The only variable are the conditions inside the organization , and that &apos;s where leadership matters , because it &apos;s the leader that sets the tone .
When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first , to sacrifice their com@@ forts and sacrifice the tangible results , so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they bel@@ ong , remarkable things happen .
I was flying on a trip , and I was witness to an incident where a passeng@@ er attemp@@ ted to board before their number was called , and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law , like a criminal .
He was y@@ elled at for attemp@@ ting to board one group too soon .
So I said something .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you have treat us like cat@@ tle ?
Why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot; &quot; And this is exactly what she said to me .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sir , if I don &apos;t follow the rules , I could get in trouble or lose my job . &quot; &quot; All she was telling me is that she doesn &apos;t feel safe . All she was telling me is that
she doesn &apos;t trust her leaders .
The reason we like flying Sou@@ th@@ west Air@@ lines is not because they necessarily hire better people .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t fear their leaders .
You see , if the conditions are wrong , we are forced to ex@@ pend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other , and that inher@@ ently wea@@ k@@ ens the organization .
When we feel safe inside the organization , we will naturally combine our talents and our str@@ eng@@ ths and work ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to face the dangers outside and se@@ ize the opportunities .
The closest analo@@ gy I can give to what a great leader is , is like being a parent .
If you think about what being a great parent is , what do you want ? What makes a great parent ?
We want to give our child opportunities , education , discipline them when necessary , all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves .
Great leaders want exactly the same thing .
Charlie K@@ im , who &apos;s the CEO of a company called Next J@@ ump in New York City , a tech company , he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family , would you ever consider l@@ aying off one of your children ?
We would never do it .
Then why do we consider l@@ aying off people inside our organization ?
Charlie implement@@ ed a policy of lifetime employment .
If you get a job at Next J@@ ump , you cannot get fi@@ red for performance issues .
In fact , if you have issues , they will coach you and they will give you support , just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school .
It &apos;s the complete opposite .
This is the reason so many people have such a vis@@ cer@@ al hat@@ red , anger , at some of these ban@@ king CE@@ Os with their dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate sal@@ aries and bon@@ us structures .
It &apos;s not the numbers .
It &apos;s that they have viol@@ ated the very definition of leadership .
They have viol@@ ated this dee@@ p-@@ se@@ ated social contract .
We know that they allowed their people to be sacri@@ fic@@ ed so they could protect their own interests , or worse , they sacri@@ fic@@ ed their people to protect their own interests .
This is what so off@@ ends us , not the numbers .
Would anybody be off@@ ended if we gave a $ 150 million bon@@ us to Gandhi ?
How about a $ 250 million bon@@ us to Mother Ter@@ es@@ a ?
Do we have an issue with that ? None at all . None at all .
Great leaders would never sacrifice
the people to save the numbers .
They would so@@ oner sacrifice the numbers to save the people .
Bob Ch@@ ap@@ man , who runs a large manufacturing company in the Mid@@ west called B@@ arr@@ y-@@ We@@ h@@ m@@ iller , in 2008 was hit very hard by the rec@@ ession , and they lost 30 percent of their orders over@@ night .
Now in a large manufacturing company , this is a big deal , and they could no longer afford their labor pool .
They needed to save 10 million dollars , so , like so many companies today , the board got together and discus@@ sed lay@@ off@@ s .
And Bob ref@@ used .
You see , Bob doesn &apos;t believe in head coun@@ ts .
Bob believ@@ es in heart coun@@ ts , and it &apos;s much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count .
And so they came up with a fur@@ l@@ ough program .
Every employ@@ ee , from sec@@ ret@@ ary to CEO , was required to take four weeks of un@@ paid vac@@ ation .
They could take it any time they wanted , and they did not have to take it con@@ sec@@ u@@ tively .
But it was how Bob announced the program that mat@@ tered so much .
He said , it &apos;s better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot , and morale went up .
And quite spon@@ taneously , nobody expected , people started trad@@ ing with each other .
Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less .
People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three .
Lea@@ dership is a choice . It is not a r@@ ank .
I know many people at the sen@@ i@@ or@@ most levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders .
They are auth@@ orities , and we do what they say because they have authority over us , but we would not follow them .
And I know many people who are at the bot@@ t@@ oms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders , and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them , and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them .
This is what a leader is .
I heard a story of some Mar@@ ines who were out in theater , and as is the Mar@@ ine cu@@ st@@ om , the offic@@ er ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
And when they went back out in the field , his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat , because that &apos;s what happens .
We call them leaders because they go first .
We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does .
We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain , and when we do , the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us .
They will give us their blood and swe@@ at and tears to see that their leader &apos;s vision comes to life , and when we ask them , &quot; &quot; Why would you do that ?
Why would you give your blood and swe@@ at and tears for that person ? &quot; &quot; they all say the same thing : &quot; Because they would have done it for me . &quot;
And isn &apos;t that the organization we would all like to work in ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
The most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
As a child , I discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality .
I learned this from my grandmother , Dr. Ru@@ th Ti@@ chau@@ er , a Jewish refugee that sett@@ led in the heart of the An@@ des .
That is how I grew up : encouraged to see beyond any lim@@ itation .
So part of my education included helping her in remote , indi@@ gen@@ ous communities .
I cher@@ ish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barri@@ ers , as language or culture .
During those tri@@ ps , my grandmother used to rec@@ ite a Ki@@ pling poem : &quot; &quot; Something hidden . Go and find it .
Go and look behind the Mount@@ ains .
Something lost behind the mountains .
Lo@@ st and waiting for you . Go ! &quot; &quot; In the coming years , I became a medical student .
One of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
There &apos;s a part of this problem I think I can solve — the part of this problem I have spent my life working on .
The problem starts during pregn@@ ancy .
The fe@@ tus needs to survive inside the mother .
Sur@@ viv@@ al depends on communication between the system@@ ic and the pul@@ mon@@ ary blood .
At the moment of birth , this communication needs to stop .
If it doesn &apos;t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
It is caused by pre@@ mat@@ urity and genetic conditions .
But what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
As you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
Video : ( Bab@@ y crying ) When you look at patients with this condition , they seem desper@@ ate to breathe .
To close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
One night , my friend Mal@@ te , were cam@@ ping in the Amazon region .
The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avoc@@ ado bran@@ ch .
Then came a moment of inspiration .
So we used the bran@@ ch as a mold for our first invention .
The holes in children &apos;s hearts can be closed with it .
A co@@ il is a piece of wire wr@@ apped onto itself .
It maybe doesn &apos;t look so f@@ ancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
In this video , we can see how a very tiny ca@@ the@@ ter takes the co@@ il to the heart .
The co@@ il then clo@@ ses the hole .
After that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
In vi@@ tro and in viv@@ o studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab .
The co@@ il , if it works , can save lives .
I returned from Germany to Bo@@ li@@ via , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
With my wife and partner , Dr. Alex@@ and@@ ra He@@ ath , we started to see patients .
After successfully treating patients with our co@@ il , we felt really enthusias@@ tic .
But we live in a place that is 1@@ 2,000 feet high .
Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time , and they die .
The first co@@ il could successfully treat only half of the patients in Bo@@ li@@ via .
The search started again .
We went back to the drawing board .
After many trials , and with the help of my grandmother &apos;s indi@@ gen@@ ous friends in the mountains , we ob@@ t@@ ained a new device .
We take this traditional method of we@@ aving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape .
It seems this time , the we@@ aving allows us to create a se@@ am@@ less device that doesn &apos;t r@@ ust because it &apos;s made of only one piece .
It can change by itself into very complex structures by a proce@@ dure that took decades to develop .
As you can see , the device en@@ ters the body through the natural channels .
Doc@@ tors have only to close the ca@@ the@@ ter through the hole .
Our device exp@@ ands , places itself and clo@@ ses the hole .
We have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself .
No open surgery was necessary .
( Applause ) As doctors , we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to he@@ al — if they do .
This is the child from before , after the proce@@ dure .
As you can see — ( Applause ) As you can see , once the device is in place , the patient is 100 percent heal@@ ed .
From start to finish , the whole proce@@ dure takes only 30 minutes .
That &apos;s very re@@ war@@ ding from the medical and human point of view .
We are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team — a team , thanks to added close interaction with patients that work with us .
To@@ gether , we have only one idea : the best solutions need to be simple .
We lost the fear of creating something new .
The path , it &apos;s not easy .
Many obstacles ar@@ ise all the time .
But we receive strength from our patients .
Their res@@ ilience and courage inspire our creativity .
Our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
So we have to start a foundation with a one-@@ to-@@ one model .
We will give one device for free to make sure that every child is treated .
We are in many countries now , but we need to be everywhere .
This whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it , really : No child is left behind .
Mu@@ ch@@ as gr@@ ac@@ i@@ as .

So I grew up in L@@ im@@ po@@ p@@ o , on the border of L@@ im@@ po@@ p@@ o and M@@ pu@@ mal@@ ang@@ a , a little town called Mot@@ et@@ ema .
W@@ ater and electricity supply are as un@@ predictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , I was rel@@ ax@@ ing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sun@@ ba@@ thing .
The L@@ im@@ po@@ p@@ o sun gets really hot in winter .
So as we were sun@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; &quot; Man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot; &quot; And I sat , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Man , I would buy that , eh ? &quot; &quot; So I went home , and I did a little research , and I found some very shoc@@ king statistics .
Over 2.@@ 5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and san@@ itation .
Four hundred and fif@@ ty million of them are in Africa , and five million of them are in South Africa .
V@@ ari@@ ous diseases thri@@ ve in this environment , the most dr@@ as@@ tic of which is called tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a .
Tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a is an infection of the eye due to dir@@ t getting into your eye . M@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple infections of tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a can leave you perman@@ ently blind .
The disease leaves eight million people perman@@ ently blind each and every year . The shoc@@ king part about it is that to avoid being infected with tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no p@@ ills , no inj@@ ections .
So after seeing these shoc@@ king statistics , I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; Okay , even if I &apos;m not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don &apos;t want to ba@@ the , I at least need to do it to try to save the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So with my tru@@ sty little ste@@ ed , my No@@ ki@@ a 6@@ 2@@ 3@@ 4 cell phone — I didn &apos;t have a laptop , I didn &apos;t have Internet much , except for the 20@@ -@@ r@@ and-@@ an-@@ hour Internet ca@@ fe — I did research on Wikipedia , on Google , about lo@@ tions , cre@@ ams , the com@@ positions , the mel@@ ting points , the tox@@ ici@@ ties — I did high school science — and I wrote down a little form@@ ula on a piece of paper ,
and it looked like the K@@ F@@ C special sp@@ ice , you know ?
So I was like , okay , so we &apos;ve got the form@@ ula ready .
Now we need to get this thing into practice .
F@@ ast forward four years later , after having written a 4@@ 0-@@ page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , I &apos;m the youn@@ g@@ est pat@@ ent-@@ hol@@ der in the country , and — ( &quot; &quot; No more ba@@ thing ! &quot; &quot; ) — I can &apos;t say any more than that . ( Laughter ) I had invented D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath , the world &apos;s first bath@@ -@@ substitu@@ ting lo@@ tion .
You literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the .
( Laughter ) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had , I went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully func@@ tioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . It &apos;s actually available on the market .
So we learned a few lessons in commerci@@ alizing and making D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath available .
One of the things we learned was that poor communities don &apos;t buy products in bul@@ k .
They buy products on demand . A person in Alex doesn &apos;t buy a box of cigar@@ ettes . They buy one cigar@@ ette each day , even though it &apos;s more expensive .
So we pack@@ aged D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath in these innovative little sach@@ ets .
You just sn@@ ap them in half , and you squ@@ ee@@ ze it out .
And the cool part is , one sach@@ et substitu@@ tes one bat@@ h for five r@@ and .
After creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implement@@ ing the product .
We realized that even rich kids from the sub@@ urb@@ s really want D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
Anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million lit@@ ers of water on average each time they ski@@ pped a bat@@ h , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for hom@@ ework , two hours more to just be a kid .
After seeing that global impact , we n@@ arro@@ wed it down to our key value proposition , which was clean@@ l@@ iness and conven@@ i@@ ence .
D@@ ry@@ B@@ ath is a rich man &apos;s conven@@ i@@ ence and a poor man &apos;s lifes@@ av@@ er .
H@@ aving put the product into practice , we are actually now on the ver@@ ge of selling the product onto a multin@@ ational to take it to the ret@@ ail market , and one question I have for the audience today is , on the grav@@ el roads of L@@ im@@ po@@ p@@ o , with an al@@ low@@ ance of 50 r@@ and a week , I came up with a way for the world not to ba@@ the .
What &apos;s stop@@ ping you ? ( Applause ) I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year Google named me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young minds in the world .
I &apos;m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first African to get that acc@@ ol@@ ade , and one thing that really puzz@@ les me is , I did all of this just because I didn &apos;t want to ba@@ the . Thank you .
( Applause . )
Five years ago , I was on a s@@ abb@@ atic@@ al , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
I saw real patients and I w@@ ore the white co@@ at for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consul@@ tant .
There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and co@@ st-@@ cutting , and the second thing , which really bo@@ ther@@ ed me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smar@@ test , most motiv@@ ated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cy@@ n@@ ical , dis@@ engaged , or had dist@@ anced themselves from hospital management .
So with this focus on co@@ st-@@ cutting , I asked myself , are we for@@ getting the patient ?
Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
And many different re@@ forms aim at holding back this growth .
In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
In other countries , new drugs are not being re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
After all , the co@@ stly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and f@@ rail patient .
So , by lim@@ iting the degrees of freedom of physici@@ ans , this is a way to hold costs down .
And ultimately , some physici@@ ans will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liber@@ ty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
At B@@ C@@ G , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of man@@ aging healthcare .
And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
U@@ l@@ timately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aim@@ ing at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
We call this valu@@ e-@@ based healthcare .
On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
This was described beauti@@ fully in a book in 2006 by Michael Por@@ ter and Elizabeth Te@@ is@@ berg .
On this picture , you have my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
When we started doing our research at B@@ C@@ G , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vas@@ tly much worse .
The differences were dramatic .
Eri@@ k , my fa@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law , he suff@@ ers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-@@ re@@ pu@@ ted healthcare system .
If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming in@@ continent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing di@@ apers again .
You flip a coin . Fif@@ ty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
If he instead would go to H@@ am@@ burg , and to a clinic called the Mar@@ tin@@ i-@@ K@@ lin@@ i@@ k , the risk would be only one in 20 .
E@@ ither you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a sev@@ en-@@ fold difference .
When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So going the hospital is a lot@@ tery .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swe@@ dish or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c surge@@ ons who met at their annu@@ al meeting , and they were discus@@ sing the different proce@@ dures they used to operate hip surgery .
To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hi@@ ps that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
They all argu@@ ed that , &quot; &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they ad@@ mitted that .
So they said , &quot; &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot; &quot; So they in fact spent two years deb@@ ating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
And they finally agreed .
And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal sh@@ af@@ t in , it actually las@@ ted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-@@ oper@@ ated on in their lifetime .
They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
Since then , they publ@@ ish every year .
Once a year , they publ@@ ish the le@@ ague table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
For many years , Swe@@ dish hip surge@@ ons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
Now I found this principle really exciting .
So the physici@@ ans get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
Con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the low@@ est costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-@@ oper@@ ated on seven years after the first surgery .
In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
So many un@@ necessary sur@@ ger@@ ies , and so much un@@ necessary suffering for all the patients who were oper@@ ated on in that seven year period .
Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
We did a study where we looked at O@@ E@@ CD data .
O@@ E@@ CD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in O@@ E@@ CD .
Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average O@@ E@@ CD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
In my practice as a consul@@ tant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
P@@ hys@@ icians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physici@@ ans have another character@@ istic .
They actually thri@@ ve from peer recognition .
If a cardi@@ ologist calls another cardi@@ ologist in a comp@@ eting hospital and discus@@ ses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
They will share the information on how to improve .
So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
This is happening in reality .
We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
To@@ gether with two academic institutions , Michael Por@@ ter at Harvard Bus@@ iness School , and the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a Institute in Sweden , B@@ C@@ G has formed something we call I@@ C@@ H@@ O@@ M .
You may think that &apos;s a s@@ nee@@ ze , but it &apos;s not a s@@ nee@@ ze , it &apos;s an ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m .
It stands for the International Con@@ sorti@@ um for Health Ou@@ t@@ come M@@ ea@@ su@@ rement .
We &apos;re bringing together leading physici@@ ans and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
They &apos;ve worked — four working groups have worked during the past year : cat@@ ar@@ acts , back pain , cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
The four groups will publ@@ ish their data in No@@ vember of this year .
That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be compar@@ ing app@@ les to app@@ les , not only within a country , but between countries .
Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
Com@@ pare app@@ les to app@@ les . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
Five months ago , I led a work@@ shop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
This particular day , we sat in a work@@ shop together with physici@@ ans , nurses and other staff , discus@@ sing l@@ eu@@ k@@ em@@ ia in children .
The group discus@@ sed , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do ?
We discus@@ sed , how do we treat these kids , what are important impro@@ vements ?
And we discus@@ sed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more effici@@ ently ?
There was an enormous energy in the room .
There were so many ideas , so much enthusias@@ m .
At the end of the meeting , the ch@@ air@@ man of the department , he stood up .
He looked over the group and he said — first he raised his hand , I for@@ got that — he raised his hand , cl@@ en@@ ched his f@@ ist , and then he said to the group , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discus@@ sing what this hospital does the right way . &quot; &quot; By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the f@@ oun@@ der of modern medicine , the Greek Hi@@ ppo@@ crates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
Thank you .

I believe that the star@@ tu@@ p organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place .
You get them to achieve unbelievable things .
That &apos;s what I wanted to find out .
I wanted to find out what actually matters most for star@@ tu@@ p success .
And I wanted to try to be system@@ atic about it , avoid some of my instinc@@ ts and maybe mis@@ perceptions I have from so many companies I &apos;ve seen over the years .
We learned a lot from those failu@@ res .
So I tried to look across what factors accoun@@ ted the most for company success and failure .
So I looked at these five .
First , the idea .
I used to think that the idea was everything .
But then over time , I came to think that maybe the team , the exec@@ ution , adap@@ tability , that mat@@ tered even more than the idea .
I never thought I &apos;d be quot@@ ing box@@ er Mike Ty@@ son on the TED stage , but he once said , &quot; &quot; Everybody has a plan , until they get pun@@ ched in the face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I think that &apos;s so true about business as well .
The custom@@ er is the true reality .
Then I started looking at the business model .
Does the company have a very clear path gener@@ ating custom@@ er reven@@ ues ?
Maybe that &apos;s the most important thing ?
And then for non-@@ I@@ de@@ al@@ ab companies , I looked at wild succ@@ esses , like Air@@ b@@ n@@ b and Inst@@ agram and U@@ ber and You@@ tube and Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In .
And some failu@@ res : We@@ b@@ van , Ko@@ z@@ mo , P@@ et@@ s@@ .com F@@ loo@@ z and Fri@@ end@@ ster .
The number one thing was tim@@ ing .
T@@ im@@ ing accoun@@ ted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
Some of our early succ@@ esses , C@@ it@@ y@@ search , came out when people needed web pages .
Go@@ To@@ .com , which we announced actually at TED in 1998 , was when companies were looking for co@@ st-@@ effective ways to get traffic .
Just two years later , when the co@@ de@@ c problem was solved by A@@ do@@ be Fl@@ ash and when broad@@ band pen@@ etr@@ ation cross@@ ed 50 percent in America , YouTube was perfectly tim@@ ed .
Great idea , but unbelievable tim@@ ing .
In fact , YouTube didn &apos;t even have a business model when it first started .
I &apos;d done well at school . Ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ efully entered the student life of lec@@ tures , parties and traffic con@@ e the@@ ft .
Un@@ der@@ neath , I was actually deeply un@@ happy , insec@@ ure and fundamentally frighten@@ ed — frighten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emp@@ tin@@ ess that I felt was within me .
I was leaving a sem@@ in@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , fum@@ bling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
I looked around , and there was no one there , but the cl@@ arity and dec@@ isi@@ veness of the comment was un@@ mis@@ ta@@ k@@ able .
&quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
And the voice pers@@ isted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narr@@ ating everything I did in the third person .
&quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
It was neutr@@ al , im@@ passive and even , after a while , strang@@ ely compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , although I did notice that its cal@@ m exter@@ ior sometimes sli@@ pped and that it occasi@@ onally mir@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ ex@@ pressed emotion .
So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very ade@@ pt at conce@@ aling how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
A subtle condi@@ tioning process had begun , the implication that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
I spent some time telling the college G@@ .@@ P@@ .
And to be fair , I was desper@@ ate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange comment@@ ator .
For example , I was part of a student TV station that broad@@ cast news bul@@ let@@ ins around the campus , and during an ap@@ point@@ ment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
It was at this point that events began to rapidly over@@ take me .
A hospital ad@@ mission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizoph@@ ren@@ ia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tor@@ ment@@ ing sense of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , hum@@ iliation and des@@ pair about myself and my pro@@ spec@@ ts .
But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symp@@ tom , my fear and resistance towards it inten@@ si@@ fied .
Now essentially , this represented taking an aggr@@ essive st@@ ance towards my own mind , a kind of psych@@ ic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressi@@ vely hosti@@ le and menac@@ ing .
You see that glass of water ?
In effect , a v@@ icious cycle of fear , avo@@ id@@ ance , mis@@ trust and mis@@ understanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ capable of establ@@ ishing any kind of peace or re@@ conc@@ iliation .
Two years later , and the deter@@ i@@ oration was dramatic .
By now , I had the whole fr@@ enz@@ ied re@@ per@@ toire : terrifying voices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ que visions , bizarre , intr@@ act@@ able del@@ u@@ sions .
Now looking back on the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age and des@@ pair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
A broken and hau@@ n@@ ted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a surviv@@ or and would ultimately grow into the person I was destin@@ ed to be .
Many people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow p@@ ale and f@@ aint in compar@@ ison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
I believe that E@@ lean@@ or can get through this .
Sometimes , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ te@@ en minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who wai@@ ted to welcome me back from that agon@@ ized , lon@@ ely place .
Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hosti@@ le and menac@@ ing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical meaning from what I &apos;d previ@@ ously interpre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al truth .
So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpre@@ t as my own sense of fear and insec@@ urity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
Now at first , I would have believed them .
I remember , for example , sitting up one night on gu@@ ard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genu@@ ine threat from the voices .
It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
I &apos;ve got a plastic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; Str@@ at@@ e@@ gic .
It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my sh@@ at@@ tered self , each frag@@ ment represented by a different voice , gradually with@@ draw from all my medication , and return to psychi@@ a@@ try , only this time from the other side .
I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Inter@@ voice , the organiz@@ ational body of the International H@@ earing Vo@@ ices Mo@@ vement , an initiative inspired by the work of Prof@@ essor M@@ ari@@ us Rom@@ me and Dr. Sand@@ ra Es@@ cher , which loc@@ ates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to in@@ sane circumstances , not as an ab@@ er@@ rant symp@@ tom of schizoph@@ ren@@ ia to be end@@ u@@ red , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explo@@ red .
This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
To par@@ aph@@ rase Ch@@ avez , once social change begins , it cannot be re@@ vers@@ ed .
You cannot hum@@ ili@@ ate the person who feels pri@@ de .
You cannot op@@ press the people who are not afraid anymore .
In the last 20 years , the H@@ earing Vo@@ ices Mo@@ vement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , soli@@ dar@@ ity and empower@@ ment for individuals in mental distr@@ ess , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an un@@ sh@@ ak@@ able belief in the power of the individual .
As Peter Lev@@ ine has said , the human animal is a unique being end@@ ow@@ ed with an instinc@@ tual capacity to he@@ al and the intellectual spirit to har@@ ness this in@@ n@@ ate capacity .
In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facil@@ it@@ ating that process of heal@@ ing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
We are unique . We are ir@@ re@@ plac@@ e@@ able .
What lies within us can never be truly colon@@ ized , cont@@ or@@ ted , or taken away .
The light never goes out .
As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trig@@ ger .
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trig@@ ger .
Phot@@ os like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected tw@@ ist .
And despite that , it ret@@ ains a level of re@@ alism .
Or photos like these — both dark and color@@ ful , but all with a common goal of ret@@ aining the level of re@@ alism .
When I say re@@ alism , I mean phot@@ o-@@ re@@ alism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
Phot@@ os where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about captur@@ ing an idea than about captur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create altern@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with combin@@ ing photographs .
It &apos;s just really about combin@@ ing different re@@ alities .
So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when combin@@ ing photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Second@@ ly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ rements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to distingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
So by mat@@ ching color , contrast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the borders between the different images , adding photographi@@ c def@@ ects like depth of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipul@@ ated .
But this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photographs from different loc@@ ations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different loc@@ ations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The shor@@ es are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swe@@ dish .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sket@@ ch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about combin@@ ing the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well plann@@ ed .
And if you do a good job captur@@ ing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .

Now , this has already started to have pretty immediate re@@ per@@ cus@@ sions .
There &apos;s been al@@ leg@@ ations of a $ 2 billion money tr@@ ail that leads back to President V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir Pu@@ tin of Russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cell@@ ist .
And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of lea@@ ked documents .
Now , this sounds like the plot of a sp@@ y thr@@ iller or a John G@@ ris@@ ham novel .
It seems very distant from you , me , ordinary people .
Why should we care about this ?
And that affects all of us .
Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world b@@ aff@@ ling and conf@@ using , and hard to understand how this sort of off@@ shore world works .
I like to think of it a bit like a Russian dol@@ l .
So you can have one company stac@@ ked inside another company , stac@@ ked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
And that &apos;s perhaps because some prom@@ in@@ ent US people just haven &apos;t figured in this exposé , in this scand@@ al .
Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are st@@ ash@@ ing their assets off@@ shore .
It &apos;s just because of the way in which off@@ shore works , Mo@@ ss@@ ack F@@ on@@ sec@@ a has fewer American clients .
I think if we saw lea@@ ks from the C@@ ay@@ man Isl@@ ands or even from Del@@ aware or W@@ y@@ om@@ ing or N@@ ev@@ ada , you would see many more cases and examples lin@@ king back to Americans .
In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
That sort of sec@@ rec@@ y in America has allowed employees of school distric@@ ts to ri@@ p off school@@ children .
It has allowed sc@@ am@@ mers to ri@@ p off vulnerable investors .
This is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
Now , at Global W@@ itness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
How does this actually work ?
Our investig@@ ator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a y@@ ach@@ t , a jet .
But as a natural optimis@@ t , I do see that we are starting to get some change .
Over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ow@@ nership .
This issue was put on the political agenda by the U@@ K Pri@@ me Min@@ ister David Cam@@ er@@ on at a big G@@ 8 S@@ um@@ mit that was held in Northern I@@ rel@@ and in 2013 .
So we &apos;d really want to see the Pan@@ ama lea@@ ks , this huge pe@@ ek into the off@@ shore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world .
For us at Global W@@ itness , this is a moment for change .
We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Sec@@ rec@@ y like this is not good for business . &quot;
We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to comm@@ it to changing the law to open up this sort of sec@@ rec@@ y .
Chris Anderson : Juli@@ an , welcome .
It &apos;s been reported that Wiki@@ Lea@@ ks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classi@@ fied documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
Can that possibly be true ?
Juli@@ an Ass@@ ange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activis@@ ts is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people release the documents ?
And how do you secure their privacy ?
J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — class@@ ical whist@@ le@@ b@@ lowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
So we use this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art en@@ cry@@ ption to boun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hide trai@@ ls , pass it through legal jur@@ is@@ dictions like Sweden and Bel@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those legal prot@@ ections .
We get information in the mail , the regular pos@@ tal mail , en@@ cryp@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant datab@@ ases of information — release it to the public and then def@@ end ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legi@@ timate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
J@@ A : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
( Ph@@ one ring ) God dam@@ n it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the C@@ IA asking what the code is for a TED mem@@ ber@@ ship . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
This is something you lea@@ ked a few years ago .
If we can have this document up ...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you lea@@ ked and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ roll Re@@ port .
This was a secret intelligence report comm@@ issi@@ oned by the Ken@@ yan government after its election in 2004 .
Pri@@ or to 2004 , Kenya was rul@@ ed by Daniel ar@@ ap Moi for about 18 years .
He was a soft dictat@@ or of Kenya .
And when Ki@@ b@@ ak@@ i got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they comm@@ issi@@ oned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the rich@@ est man — still is the rich@@ est man — in Kenya .
It &apos;s the Ho@@ ly G@@ rail of Ken@@ yan journalis@@ m .
So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just pri@@ or to the election — the national election , Dec@@ ember 28 .
When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Ki@@ b@@ ak@@ i , had decided to p@@ al up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel ar@@ ap Moi , so this report then became a dead al@@ ba@@ tro@@ ss around President Ki@@ b@@ ak@@ i &apos;s neck .
CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report lea@@ ked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirec@@ tly , and in your opinion , it actually shif@@ ted the election .
J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front page of the Gu@@ ardi@@ an and was then printed in all the surr@@ ounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzan@@ ian and South African press .
And so it came in from the outside .
And that , after a couple of days , made the Ken@@ yan press feel safe to talk about it .
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Ken@@ yan TV , shif@@ ted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Ken@@ yan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
CA : Wow , so your lea@@ k really substanti@@ ally changed the world ?
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Bag@@ h@@ dad air@@ strike video .
The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
This is — this is intense material , I should war@@ n you .
R@@ adi@@ o : ... just f@@ uc@@ kin &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
I see your element , u@@ h , got about four Hum@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ...
You &apos;re clear . All right . F@@ iring .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .

( Mach@@ ine gun fire ) Ke@@ ep shoot &apos; n . Ke@@ ep shoot &apos; n . ( Mach@@ ine gun fire ) Ke@@ ep shoot &apos; n .
H@@ ot@@ el ... B@@ ush@@ master Tw@@ o-@@ Six , B@@ ush@@ master Tw@@ o-@@ Six ,
we need to move , time now !
All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicop@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing .
Ro@@ ger . I got &apos; em .
Tw@@ o-@@ Six , this is Tw@@ o-@@ Six , we &apos;re mobile .
O@@ ops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
God dam@@ n it , Ky@@ le . All right , h@@ ah@@ ah@@ a . I hit &apos; em .
CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
J@@ A : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
We ended up sending two people to Bag@@ h@@ dad to further research that story .
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two R@@ eu@@ ters employees ?
J@@ A : Yeah . Two R@@ eu@@ ters employees , two young children were w@@ ounded .
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
CA : And rele@@ asing this caused wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad ou@@ tr@@ age .
What was the key element of this that actually caused the ou@@ tr@@ age , do you think ?
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gro@@ ss dispar@@ ity in force .
You have guys walking in a rel@@ ax@@ ed way down the street , and then an A@@ pa@@ che helicop@@ ter sitting up at one kilom@@ eter fir@@ ing 3@@ 0-@@ milli@@ meter c@@ ann@@ on shel@@ ls on everyone — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people res@@ cu@@ ing the w@@ ounded .
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t in@@ surg@@ ents because that &apos;s their full-@@ time job .
CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analy@@ st , Br@@ ad@@ ley M@@ ann@@ ing , arrested , and it &apos;s al@@ leg@@ ed that he conf@@ essed in a chat room to have lea@@ ked this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 classi@@ fied U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y c@@ ables .
I mean , did he ?
J@@ A : We have den@@ ied rece@@ iving those c@@ ables .
He has been charg@@ ed , about five days ago , with ob@@ t@@ aining 15@@ 0,000 c@@ ables and rele@@ asing 50 .
Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y , but this is not necessarily connected .
I mean , I was a known visit@@ or of that emb@@ ass@@ y .
CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y diplom@@ atic c@@ ables ...
J@@ A : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human@@ -@@ rights ab@@ uses in those governments .
If you look at dec@@ las@@ si@@ fied c@@ ables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broad@@ ly about this .
I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it right to encourage lea@@ king of secret information ?
J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So information that organizations are spending economic effort into conce@@ aling , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conce@@ al it .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalis@@ m is .
CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ intended consequence ?
J@@ A : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
I mean , we have a harm imm@@ uni@@ zation policy .
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identi@@ fying information in it .
But there are legi@@ timate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legi@@ timate secret — but we deal with whist@@ le@@ b@@ lowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-@@ motiv@@ ated .
CA : So they are well-@@ motiv@@ ated .
And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incenti@@ ve to put out .
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are in@@ human people .
Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
But remember , the people in Bag@@ h@@ dad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
Li@@ ght is good .
But do you see any ir@@ ony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your sources ?
J@@ A : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any Wiki@@ Lea@@ ks dissi@@ dents yet .
We don &apos;t have sources who are dissi@@ dents on other sources .
Should they come forward , that would be a trick@@ y situation for us , but we &apos;re pres@@ um@@ ably acting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ elled to continue our mission , not to scre@@ w it up .
CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
You know , there might be a couple of views of Wiki@@ Lea@@ ks and of Juli@@ an .
You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
D@@ anger@@ ous trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker .
Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
Who &apos;s got the dangerous trou@@ bl@@ em@@ aker view ?
J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Juli@@ an , a soft crowd .
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet lea@@ ked , but I think for TED you are .
I mean it &apos;s an intrigu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
So late last year — in No@@ vember last year — there was a series of well b@@ low@@ outs in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well b@@ low@@ out in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security gu@@ ards from some riv@@ al , various comp@@ eting oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked trucks there and blo@@ wn them up .
And part of the Al@@ ban@@ ian government was in this , etc . , etc .
And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of skep@@ tical that maybe it was a comp@@ eting oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skep@@ tical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Wor@@ d I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
This is like one of our methods of identi@@ fying , of ver@@ i@@ fying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of serious fun@@ d@@ raising and engineering effort .
So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minim@@ ized while we &apos;re re-@@ engineering our back systems for the phenomen@@ al public interest that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organization , we are sort of overwhel@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quanti@@ ty of whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clo@@ sures of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ eck , basically journalis@@ tic volunteers and / or the funding of journalis@@ tic sal@@ aries ?
J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tru@@ sted people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to res@@ truc@@ ture in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
Can that be right ?
J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the combination between the two ...
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psycho@@ logist might say that &apos;s a reci@@ pe for bre@@ eding par@@ an@@ o@@ ia .
J@@ A : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hack@@ er at an early age and ran into the auth@@ orities early on .
J@@ A : Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young journalist activis@@ t at an early age .
I wrote a magazine , was pro@@ sec@@ u@@ ted for it when I was a teen@@ ager .
So you have to be careful with hack@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deploy@@ ed for various things .
Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deploy@@ ed by the Russian ma@@ fi@@ a in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accoun@@ ts .
So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ aling anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nur@@ ture victims .
And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
CA : Cap@@ able , generous men do not create victims ; they nur@@ ture victims ?
J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a comb@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of nur@@ tur@@ ing victims , which is to police perpe@@ tr@@ ators of crime .
And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in I@@ cel@@ and ?
You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was inj@@ un@@ c@@ ted from running the story .
Instead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side .
That made you very high-@@ pro@@ file in I@@ cel@@ and . What happened next ?
J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
I@@ cel@@ and went through this financial crisis .
It was the hard@@ est hit of any country in the world .
I@@ ts ban@@ king sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
Anyway , so we release this report in Ju@@ ly last year .
And the national TV station was inj@@ un@@ c@@ ted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : inj@@ un@@ c@@ tion landed on the news desk , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a f@@ iller , and we became very famous in I@@ cel@@ and , went to I@@ cel@@ and and spoke about this issue .
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of pack@@ age of leg@@ islation for I@@ cel@@ and to sort of become an off@@ shore haven for the free press , with the strong@@ est journalis@@ tic prot@@ ections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
I@@ cel@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ di@@ c country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
And just a month ago , this was passed by the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ ament un@@ anim@@ ously .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Juli@@ an .
When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Bro@@ ther exer@@ ting more control , more sec@@ rec@@ y , or us watching Big Bro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there &apos;s enormous pres@@ sures to harmon@@ ize freedom of speech leg@@ islation and transparency leg@@ islation around the world — within the E.@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States .
Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m refl@@ ecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Juli@@ an , be careful , and all power to you .
J@@ A : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I feel incredibly lucky to be from a country that &apos;s generally considered to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in I@@ cel@@ and went on a strike .
They did no work that day , whether they held professional jobs or had the work of the home .
They mar@@ ched into the center of R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ av@@ í@@ k — 90 percent of women particip@@ ated — and peace@@ fully and in soli@@ dar@@ ity asked for equality .
Nothing worked in I@@ cel@@ and that day , because nothing works when women are not at work .
( Applause ) Five years later , I@@ cel@@ and@@ ers had the courage to be the first country in the world to demo@@ crati@@ c@@ ally el@@ ect a woman as their president .
I will never forget this day , that President V@@ ig@@ d@@ í@@ s , as we know her by her first name , ste@@ pped out on the bal@@ con@@ y of her own home , a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won .
( Applause ) This woman was an incredible role model for me and everyone growing up at that time , including boys .
She frequ@@ ently shar@@ es the story of how a young boy approach@@ ed her after a couple of terms in office and asked , &quot; &quot; Can boys really grow up to be president ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) R@@ ole models really matter , but even with such strong role models who I am so grateful for , when I was encouraged to run for president , my first reaction was , &quot; &quot; Who am I to run for president ?
Who am I to be president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men .
So a study done in the US in 2011 showed that 6@@ 2 percent of men had considered running for office , but 45 percent of women .
That &apos;s gap of 16 percentage points , and it &apos;s the same gap that existed a decade earlier .
And it really is a shame , because I am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders and more princi@@ pl@@ e-@@ based leadership in general .
So my decision to run ultimately came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit , even if I had no political experience , to step up and try to be part of creating the world that will make sense and be sustainable for our kids , and a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls to be all they can be .
And it was the journey of my life .
It was amazing .
The journey started with potentially as many as 20 candi@@ dates .
It bo@@ iled down to nine candi@@ dates quali@@ fying , and ultimately the race came down to four of us , three men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not all the dr@@ ama yet .
So our sitting president of 20 years announced initially that he was not going to run , which is probably what gave rise to so many candi@@ dates consi@@ dering running .
Then later he changed his mind when our prime minister res@@ ign@@ ed following the in@@ famous Pan@@ ama P@@ apers that impl@@ icated him and his family .
And there was a popular prot@@ est in I@@ cel@@ and , so the sitting president thought they needed a tru@@ sted leader .
A few days later , relations to his wife and her family &apos;s companies were also discovered in the Pan@@ ama P@@ apers , and so he with@@ drew from the race again .
Before doing so , he said he was doing that because now there were two quali@@ fied men who he felt could fill his shoes running for office .
So on May 9 , 45 days before election day , it was not looking too good for me .
I did not even make the graph in the newspaper .
The pol@@ ls had me at 1 percent , but that was still the highest that any woman announc@@ ing her candi@@ d@@ acy had ear@@ ned .
So it would be an underst@@ atement to say that I had to work extremely hard to get my seat at the table and access to television , because the network decided that they would only include those with 2.@@ 5 percent or more in the pol@@ ls in the first TV debate .
I found out on the afternoon of the first TV debate that I would participate along with the three men , and I found out on live TV that I came in at exactly 2.@@ 5 percent on the day of the first TV debate .
( Applause ) So , challenges .
The fore@@ most challenges I had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with media , muscle and money .
Let &apos;s start with media .
There are those who say gender doesn &apos;t matter when it comes to media and politics .
I can &apos;t say that I agree .
It pro@@ ved harder for me to both get access and air@@ time in media .
As a matter of fact , the leading candi@@ date appeared in broad@@ cast media 8@@ 7 times in the months leading up to the elections , whereas I appeared 31 times .
And I am not saying media is doing this consci@@ ously .
When I finally got access to TV , the first question I got was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to quit ? &quot; &quot; And that was a hard one .
But of course , with 1 percent to 2.@@ 5 percent in the pol@@ ls , maybe it &apos;s underst@@ and@@ able .
But media really matters , and every time I appeared on TV , we saw and experienced a rise in the pol@@ ls , so I know fir@@ s@@ th@@ and how much this matters and why we have to talk about it .
I was the only one out of the final four candi@@ dates that never got a front page interview .
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candi@@ dates and out of co@@ ver@@ age about the elections .
So I did face this , but I will say this to compl@@ iment the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c media .
I got few if any comm@@ ents about my hair and p@@ ant@@ suit .
( Applause ) So k@@ u@@ dos to them .
But there is another experience that &apos;s very important .
I ran as an independent candi@@ date , not with any political party or muscle behind me .
That lack of experience and lack of access to resources probably came at a cost to our campaign , but it also allowed us to innov@@ ate and do politics differently .
We ran a positive campaign , and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that .
It may be the reason why I had less air@@ time on TV , because I wanted to show other cont@@ end@@ ers respect .
When access to media pro@@ ved to be so difficult , we ran our own media .
I ran live Facebook s@@ essions where I took questions from vot@@ ers on anything and respon@@ ded on the spot .
And we put all the questions I got and all the answers on an open Facebook because we thought transparency is important if you want to establ@@ ish trust .
I got young people to teach me how to do that , and I used every filter on S@@ n@@ ap@@ chat during the last part of the campaign .
And I actually had to use a lot of hu@@ mor and hum@@ ility , as I was very bad at it .
But we grew the following amongst young people by doing that .
So it &apos;s possible to run a different type of campaign .
But unfortunately , one cannot talk about politics without menti@@ oning money .
I am sad that it is that way , but it &apos;s true , and we had less financial resources than the other candi@@ dates .
This probably was partly due to the fact that I think I had a harder time asking for financial support .
And maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less .
Some would call that very wom@@ an@@ ly of me .
But even with one third the media , one third the financial resources , and only an entrepreneuri@@ al team , but an amazing team , we managed to surprise everyone on election night , when the first numbers came in .
I surprised myself , as you may see in that photo .
( Laughter ) So the first numbers , I came in neck to neck to the leading candi@@ date .
Some people call me the real win@@ ner of the election because of this , and there are many people who encouraged me to run again .
But what really makes me proud is to know that I ear@@ ned propor@@ tion@@ ately higher percentage support from the young people , and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in 20@@ 40 .
( Applause ) She is 13 , and she had never been on TV before .
And on election day , I observ@@ ed her on TV repe@@ at@@ edly , and she was smart , she was self-@@ confident , she was sinc@@ ere , and she was sup@@ por@@ tive of her mother .
This was probably the high@@ light of my campaign .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
These are pres@@ chool girls out on a walk , and they found a poster of me on a bus stop , and they saw the need to k@@ iss it .
Audience : A@@ w !
This picture was really enough of a win for me .
What we see , we can be .
So scre@@ w fear and challenges .
( Applause ) It matters that women run , and it &apos;s time for women to run for office , be it the office of the CEO or the office of the president .
I also managed to put an impression on your very own &quot; &quot; New Yor@@ ker . &quot; &quot; I ear@@ ned a new title , &quot; &quot; A living emo@@ j@@ i of sin@@ cer@@ ity . &quot; &quot; ( Che@@ ers ) It is possibly my prou@@ dest title yet , and the reason is that women too often get pen@@ alized for using what I call their emotional capital , but I know from experience that we become so good when we do just that .
( Applause ) And we need more of that .
We celebr@@ ated as if we had won on election night , because that &apos;s how we felt .
So you don &apos;t necessarily have to reach that office .
You just have to go for it , and you , your family , your friends , everyone working with you , if you do it well , you will grow beyond anything you will experience before .
So we had a good time , and I learned a lot on this journey , probably more lessons than I can share here in the time we have today .
But rest assu@@ red , it was hard work .
I lost a lot of sleep during those months .
It took res@@ ilience and pers@@ ever@@ ance to not quit , but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day , and that is that you can only be good when you are truly , authenti@@ c@@ ally listening to your own voice and working in align@@ ment with that .
As a good sister of mine sometimes says , you may che@@ at on your intuition , but your intuition never che@@ ats on you .
I think it &apos;s also very important , and you all know this , that on any journey you go on , it &apos;s the team you take along .
It &apos;s having people around you who share your values , your vision , but are different in every other way .
That &apos;s the form@@ ula for success for me , and I am bl@@ essed with an amazing husband , here today , an incredible family — ( Applause ) and great friends , and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political ar@@ ena , and pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible .
As a matter of fact , the leading PR expert told me before I made my decision that I would do well to get seven percent .
I appreci@@ ated his perspective , because he was probably right , and he was bas@@ ing it on valuable experience .
But on the one percent day , I decided here to show him that he was wrong .
It &apos;s very important to mention this , because I did lose a lot of sleep , and I worked hard , and so did the people with me .
We can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves .
And it &apos;s two things that I think are very important in that , in surr@@ ounding yourself with people and practices that nour@@ ish you , but it &apos;s equally important , maybe even more important , to have the courage to get rid of people and practices that take away your energy , including the wonderful blo@@ gg@@ ers and comment@@ ators .
I took a lot of support from others in doing this , and I made the decision to go high when others went low , and that &apos;s partly how I kept my energy going throughout all of this .
And when I lost my energy for a moment — and I did from time to time , it wasn &apos;t easy — I went back to why I decided to run , and how I had decided to run my own race .
I called it a 4@@ G campaign , the G &apos;s repres@@ enting the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c words .
And the first one is called &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n . &quot; &quot; I ran to do good , to be of service , and I wanted serv@@ ant leadership to be at the center of how I worked and everybody else in the campaign .
Second one is &quot; &quot; G@@ le@@ ð@@ i , &quot; &quot; or joy .
I decided to enjoy the journey .
There was a lot to be taken out of the journey , no matter if the destination was reached or not .
And I tried my ut@@ most to inspire others to do so as well .
Third is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n@@ s@@ æ@@ i . &quot; &quot; I was open to any questions .
I kept no secrets , and it was all open , on Facebook and web@@ sites .
Because I think if you &apos;re choosing your president , you deserve answers to your questions .
Last but not least , I don &apos;t need to explain that in this room , we ran on the principle of Gir@@ l@@ power .
( Che@@ ers ) I am incredibly glad that I had the courage to run , to risk failure but receive success on so many levels .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was easy , but I can tell you , and I think my entire team will agree with me , that it was worth it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
P@@ at M@@ itch@@ ell : I &apos;m not letting you go yet . Hal@@ la T@@ ó@@ mas@@ d@@ ó@@ t@@ tir : What a great crowd . PM : I can &apos;t let you go without saying
that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to I@@ cel@@ and and vote for you .
But of course we probably can &apos;t vote there , but one thing we can get from I@@ cel@@ and and have always gotten is inspiration .
I mean , I &apos;m old enough to remember 1975 when all the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c women walked out , and that really was a very big factor in laun@@ ching the women &apos;s movement .
You made a reference to it earlier . I &apos;d love to bring the picture back up and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a stand@@ still .
And then what you may not know because our American media did not report it , the I@@ cel@@ an@@ di@@ c women walked out again on Mon@@ day . Right ?
H@@ T : Yes , they did . PM : Can you tell us about that ?
H@@ T : Yes , so 4@@ 1 years after the original strike , we may be the best place in the world to be a woman , but our work isn &apos;t done .
( Applause ) What &apos;s really cool about this is that young women and men particip@@ ated in greater numbers than before , because it is time that we close the pay gap .
PM : So I &apos;m not going to ask Hal@@ la to comm@@ it right now to what she &apos;s doing next , but I will say that you &apos;d have a very large volunte@@ er army should you decide to do that again .
Thank you Hal@@ la .
H@@ T : Thank you all .
( Applause )

I &apos;ve been wrong a lot l@@ ately .

What that means is pre@@ pping my out@@ fit , ( Laughter ) pre@@ pping options , trying to figure out what I &apos;m coming behind and going in front of .
Po@@ etry does that .
It pre@@ ps you . It aims you .
So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
But I &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
H@@ old her now with you .
You don &apos;t need to say her name out loud , you can just hold her .
Are you holding her ?
This is &quot; &quot; Bre@@ ak C@@ lu@@ st@@ ered . &quot; &quot; All ho@@ ly history bann@@ ed .
Un@@ written books predicted the future , proj@@ ected the past .
But my head un@@ wr@@ aps around what appears limit@@ less , man &apos;s creative violence .
Wh@@ ose son shall it be ?
Which male child will per@@ ish a new day ?
Our boys &apos; deaths gal@@ van@@ ize .
We cher@@ ish cor@@ p@@ ses .
We mour@@ n women , complicated .
B@@ it@@ ches get beat daily .

All colors run , none of us solid .
Don &apos;t look for shadow behind me . I carry it within .
I live cycles of light and darkness .
R@@ hy@@ th@@ m is half silence .
I see now , I never was one and not the other .
S@@ ick@@ ness , health , tend@@ er violence .
I think now I never was pure .
Before form I was storm , blind , ign &apos;@@ ant — still am .
Human contr@@ acted itself blind , mal@@ ign@@ ant .
I never was pure .
Girl spo@@ iled before ri@@ pen@@ ed .

I experience exponenti@@ ally .
Everything is everything .
One woman lo@@ ses 15 , maybe 20 , members of her family .
One woman lo@@ ses six .
One woman lo@@ ses her head .
One woman sear@@ ches ru@@ bble . One woman fe@@ eds on tr@@ ash .
One woman sho@@ ots her face . One woman sho@@ ots her husband .
One woman str@@ aps herself .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman gives birth to borders .
One woman no longer believ@@ es love will ever find her .
One woman never did .
Where do refugee hearts go ?

When I was a student here in Oxford in the 197@@ 0s , the future of the world was bl@@ ea@@ k .
The population explosion was un@@ stop@@ p@@ able .
Global famine was inevitable .
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shor@@ ten our lives .
The ac@@ id rain was falling on the forests .
The desert was adv@@ ancing by a mile or two a year .
The oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
None of those things happened , ( Laughter ) and aston@@ ish@@ ingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per@@ -@@ capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , ad@@ just@@ ed for inflation , has tri@@ pled .
Li@@ f@@ esp@@ an is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
Child mortality is down by two-@@ thirds .
Per@@ -@@ capita food production is up by a third .
And all this at a time when the population has doubl@@ ed .
How did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
How did we achieve that ?
How did we become the only species that becomes more prosper@@ ous as it becomes more popul@@ ous ?
The size of the blo@@ b in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents GDP per capita .
I think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and re@@ combine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
In other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
I want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
These are both real objects .
One is an A@@ ch@@ eu@@ le@@ an hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by Homo er@@ ectu@@ s .
The other is obviously a computer mouse .
They &apos;re both exactly the same size and shape to an un@@ c@@ anny degree .
I &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
And that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
They &apos;re both technologies . In the end , their simil@@ arity is not that interesting .
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
The differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty un@@ var@@ ying design for about a million years — from one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half million years ago to half a million years ago .
Homo er@@ ectu@@ s made the same tool for 30,000 generations .
Of course there were a few changes , but tools changed s@@ lower than skelet@@ ons in those days .
There was no progress , no innovation .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
Wh@@ ereas the object on the right is obsol@@ ete after five years .
And there &apos;s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
The object on the right is made from a conf@@ ection of different substances , from sil@@ icon and metal and plastic and so on .
And more than that , it &apos;s a conf@@ ection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transist@@ ors .
They &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
And it &apos;s this combination , this c@@ umul@@ ative technology , that intr@@ ig@@ ues me , because I think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
My body &apos;s an accumul@@ ation of ideas too : the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
They &apos;ve come together .
How does evolution do c@@ umul@@ ative , combin@@ at@@ orial things ?
Well , it uses sexual reproduction .
In an as@@ exu@@ al species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
One goes extinct for the other to survive .
But if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inher@@ it both mutations from different lin@@ e@@ ages .
So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
It &apos;s not confin@@ ed to its own lin@@ e@@ age .
What &apos;s the process that &apos;s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution ?
And I think the answer is exchange , the habit of ex@@ changing one thing for another .
It &apos;s a unique human feature .
No other animal does it .
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange — and indeed there &apos;s reci@@ proc@@ ity in other animals — But the exchange of one object for another never happens .
As Adam Smith said , &quot; &quot; No man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You can have culture without exchange .
You can have , as it were , as@@ exu@@ al culture .
Ch@@ impanz@@ ees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
They teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to off@@ spring .
In this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
But the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumul@@ ate , never become combin@@ at@@ orial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
Ch@@ impanz@@ ee tro@@ ops have different cultures in different tro@@ ops .
There &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
And why does exchange raise living standards ?
Well , the answer came from David R@@ ic@@ ardo in 18@@ 17 .
And here is a St@@ one Age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
Adam takes four hours to make a sp@@ ear and three hours to make an axe .
O@@ z takes one hour to make a sp@@ ear and two hours to make an axe .
So O@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than Adam .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
He can make his own spe@@ ars and ax@@ es .
Well no , because if you think about it , if O@@ z makes two spe@@ ars and Adam make two ax@@ es , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
And the more they do this , the more true it &apos;s going to be , because the more they do this , the better Adam is going to get at making ax@@ es and the better O@@ z is going to get at making spe@@ ars .
So the gains from trade are only going to grow .
And this is one of the beau@@ ties of exchange , is it actually creates the mom@@ en@@ tum for more speci@@ alization , which creates the mom@@ en@@ tum for more exchange and so on .
Adam and O@@ z both saved an hour of time .
That is prosper@@ ity , the saving of time in satis@@ fying your needs .
As@@ k yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
If you had to start from scratch , let &apos;s say you go out into the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
You find a sheep . You kill it . You get the fat out of it .
You rend@@ er it down . You make a cand@@ le , etc. etc .
How long is it going to take you ? Qu@@ ite a long time .
How long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you &apos;re on the average w@@ age in Britain today ?
And the answer is about half a second .
Back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average w@@ age to acqu@@ ire that much light .
And that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosper@@ ity that you &apos;ve g@@ ained since 1950 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acqu@@ ire another good or service .
And back in 18@@ 80 , it would have been 15 minutes to earn that amount of light on the average w@@ age .
Back in 18@@ 00 , you &apos;d have had to work six hours to earn a cand@@ le that could burn for an hour .
In other words , the average person on the average w@@ age could not afford a cand@@ le in 18@@ 00 .
Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; &quot; Who made them and for who ? &quot; &quot; The stone axe was made by someone for himself .
It was self-@@ suffici@@ ency .
We call that poverty these days .
But the object on the right was made for me by other people .
How many other people ?
T@@ ens ? Hun@@ dre@@ ds ? Th@@ ou@@ sands ?
You know , I think it &apos;s probably millions .
Because you &apos;ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was bre@@ wed for the man who was on the oil ri@@ g , who was dr@@ illing for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
They were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
And that &apos;s the way society works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
In the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
That &apos;s how you got to be rich ; you employ@@ ed them .
Lou@@ is X@@ I@@ V had a lot of people working for him .
They made his silly out@@ fits , like this , ( Laughter ) and they did his silly h@@ air@@ sty@@ les , or whatever .
He had 4@@ 98 people to prepare his dinner every night .
But a modern tour@@ ist going around the pal@@ ace of Ver@@ s@@ ailles and looking at Lou@@ is X@@ I@@ V &apos;s pictures , he has 4@@ 98 people doing his dinner tonight too .
They &apos;re in bis@@ tro@@ s and caf@@ es and restaurants and shops all over Paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than Lou@@ is X@@ I@@ V even had .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , because we &apos;re all working for each other .
We &apos;re able to draw upon speci@@ alization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
Now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
An@@ ts are a classic example ; workers work for que@@ ens and que@@ ens work for workers .
But there &apos;s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
There &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
And the reason for that is because there &apos;s a re@@ productive division of labor .
That is to say , they speci@@ alize with respect to reproduction .
The qu@@ een does it all .
In our species , we don &apos;t like doing that .
It &apos;s the one thing we ins@@ ist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
( Laughter ) Even in England , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the Queen .
( Applause ) So when did this habit start ?
And how long has it been going on ? And what does it mean ?
Well , I think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
But I &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
It just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
In all hun@@ ter-@@ gather@@ er societies today , there &apos;s a for@@ aging division of labor between , on the whole , hun@@ ting males and gathering fem@@ ales .
It isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between speci@@ alized ro@@ les for males and fem@@ ales .
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
The woman knows that , in the H@@ ad@@ z@@ as &apos; case here — di@@ gging roots to share with men in exchange for meat — she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
And she doesn &apos;t have to go on an ex@@ hau@@ sting hun@@ t and try and kill a war@@ tho@@ g .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any di@@ gging to get roots .
All he has to do is make sure that when he kill@@ s a war@@ tho@@ g it &apos;s big enough to share some .
And so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
When did this happen ? We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible that Neander@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do this .
They were a highly co@@ oper@@ ative species .
They were a highly intelligent species .
Their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
They were imagin@@ ative . They buried their dead .
They had language , probably , because we know they had the FO@@ X@@ P@@ 2 gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in Oxford .
And so it looks like they probably had lingu@@ istic skills .
They were brilliant people . I &apos;m not dis@@ sing the Neander@@ th@@ als .
But there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by fem@@ ales .
It looks like the fem@@ ales were co@@ oper@@ ative hun@@ ters with the men .
And the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in Neander@@ thal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
For example , in the C@@ auc@@ a@@ sus there &apos;s a site where you find local Neander@@ thal tools .
They &apos;re always made from local cher@@ t .
In the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , 30,000 years ago , and some of those are from local cher@@ t , but more — but many of them are made from ob@@ si@@ di@@ an from a long way away .
And when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were ex@@ changing between groups .
Trade is 10 times as old as farming .
People forget that . People think of trade as a modern thing .
Ex@@ change between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
And the ear@@ liest evidence for it crops up somewhere between 80 and 1@@ 20,000 years ago in Africa , when you see ob@@ si@@ di@@ an and j@@ as@@ per and other things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
You also see seas@@ hel@@ ls — as discovered by a team here in Oxford — moving 1@@ 25 miles in@@ land from the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an in Al@@ ger@@ ia .
And that &apos;s evidence that people have started ex@@ changing between groups .
And that will have led to speci@@ alization .
How do you know that long-@@ distance movement means trade rather than migration ?
Well , you look at modern hun@@ ter gather@@ ers like abor@@ ig@@ in@@ als , who qu@@ arri@@ ed for stone ax@@ es at a place called M@@ oun@@ t I@@ sa , which was a qu@@ arry owned by the K@@ al@@ k@@ ado@@ on tri@@ be .
They trad@@ ed them with their neighbors for things like st@@ in@@ gray bar@@ bs , and the consequence was that stone ax@@ es ended up over a large part of Australia .
So long-@@ distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
What happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and speci@@ alize ?
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
An example is Tas@@ mani@@ a .
When the sea level rose and Tas@@ mani@@ a became an island 10,000 years ago , the people on it not only experienced s@@ lower progress than people on the main@@ land , they actually experienced re@@ gr@@ ess .
They gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the speci@@ alized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
It &apos;s as if the people in this room were plon@@ ked on a desert island .
How many of the things in our po@@ ck@@ ets could we continue to make after 10,000 years ?
It didn &apos;t happen in Ti@@ erra del Fu@@ ego — similar island , similar people .
The reason : because Ti@@ erra del Fu@@ ego is separated from South America by a much n@@ arro@@ wer straight , and there was trad@@ ing contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years .
The Tas@@ mani@@ ans were isolated .
Go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
In the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
But who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
Nobody , literally nobody .
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
I mean this quite seriously .
The president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
He just knows how to run a company .
The person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
We all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
I am of course quot@@ ing from a famous ess@@ ay by Leon@@ ard R@@ ead , the econom@@ ist in the 195@@ 0s , called &quot; &quot; I , P@@ enc@@ il &quot; &quot; in which he wrote about how a pen@@ cil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pen@@ cil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graph@@ ite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
And what we &apos;ve done in human society , through exchange and speci@@ alization , is we &apos;ve created the ability to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
With language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
But with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
We &apos;ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
And by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that I &apos;m not interested in the debate about I.@@ Q@@ . , about whether some groups have higher I.@@ Q@@ .@@ s than other groups .
It &apos;s completely ir@@ relevant .
What &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communic@@ ating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re co@@ operating , not how clever the individuals are .
So we &apos;ve created something called the collective brain .
We &apos;re just the no@@ des in the network .
We &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
It &apos;s the inter@@ change of ideas , the meeting and mat@@ ing of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incre@@ mentally , bit by bit .
However , bad things happen .
And in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
There will be wars ; there will be de@@ pres@@ sions ; there will be natural dis@@ as@@ ters .
A@@ w@@ ful things will happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , I &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
Because through the cloud , through crowd sourc@@ ing , through the bot@@ tom@@ -up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the el@@ ites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely acceler@@ ating the rate of innovation .
Thank you .

Good afternoon .
My name is U@@ l@@ dus .
I am a phot@@ o-@@ based artist from Russia .
I focus on bal@@ ancing meaningful message , aes@@ thetic , beauty , composition , some ir@@ ony , and arti@@ facts .
This boy is a professional d@@ ancer , only 12 years old , but at second@@ ary school , he hi@@ des his dancing classes and is wearing the mas@@ k of bru@@ tal@@ ity , trying to be un@@ ited with the rest of his class@@ mates like a storm tro@@ op@@ er has no personality .
But this boy has goals and dreams but hi@@ des it to be soci@@ ally accepted , because being different isn &apos;t easy , especially in Russia .
Next portrait interpret@@ ation is met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ic .
He likes to say , &quot; &quot; You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry , &quot; &quot; quot@@ ing H@@ ul@@ k from the movie , but I &apos;ve never seen him angry .
He hi@@ des his sensi@@ ti@@ vities and roman@@ tic side , because in Russia , among guys , that &apos;s not cool to be roman@@ tic , but it &apos;s cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggr@@ essive h@@ ul@@ k .
( Laughter ) Th@@ rough the arti@@ facts , I bring social issues which surr@@ ound me in Russia into the conversation .
Inter@@ es@@ ting fact about marriage in Russia , that most of the 18 , 19@@ -year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
For Russian society , I &apos;m an old m@@ aid and hop@@ eless to ever get married .
That &apos;s why you see me in a Mex@@ ican figh@@ ter mas@@ k , in the we@@ dding dress , all desper@@ ate in my garden .
But remember , ir@@ ony is the key , and this is actually to motiv@@ ate girls to fight for goals , for dreams , and change stere@@ oty@@ pes .
Be brave . Be ir@@ onic — it helps .
Be funny and create some magic .
( Applause )
My name is Am@@ it .
And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with mus@@ eu@@ ms and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun , negoti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting mus@@ eu@@ ms from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
And I grew up in India .
I had a great education — I &apos;m not compl@@ aining — but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these mus@@ eu@@ ms and these art@@ works .
And so when I started traveling and going to these mus@@ eu@@ ms , I started learning a lot .
And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
So , simple : you come to Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ Proj@@ ect@@ .@@ com@@ .
You look around at all these mus@@ eu@@ ms here .
You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you &apos;ve got the Mo@@ MA , the Her@@ mit@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an Go@@ gh .
I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the Me@@ tropolit@@ an Museum of Art in New York .
Two ways of going in — very simple .
C@@ lic@@ k and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are — B@@ omb@@ ay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
You move around , you have fun .
You want to navig@@ ate around the museum ?
O@@ pen the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corri@@ d@@ or .
Ke@@ ep going . Have fun .
Ex@@ pl@@ ore .
( Applause ) Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
( Laughter ) So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; &quot; The Harv@@ es@@ ters &quot; &quot; by Pi@@ eter Bru@@ eg@@ el at the M@@ et .
I see this plus sign .
If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the met@@ a-@@ data information .
For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this — but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gig@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pix@@ els .
And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pix@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pix@@ els .
You can zoom around very simply .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his expression is pric@@ eless .
But then you really want to go deep .
And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
And I was like , &quot; &quot; H@@ old on . That sounds interesting . &quot; &quot; W@@ ent in , and I started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all , which involves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a stick on Sh@@ ro@@ ve Tu@@ es@@ day .
And apparently it was quite popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cr@@ acks .
Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
( Applause ) The best is yet to come — so in a second .
So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the Mo@@ MA , again in New York .
So another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; &quot; The St@@ arry N@@ ight . &quot; &quot; Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
But what if you want to see brush str@@ o@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an Go@@ gh actually created this mas@@ ter@@ piece ?
You zoom in . You really go in .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ acks .
This is &quot; &quot; The St@@ arry N@@ ight , &quot; &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Coll@@ ections .
Any one of you , anybody — doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a f@@ ancy house — doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own museum online — create your own collection across all these images .
Very simply , you go in — and I &apos;ve created this , called The Po@@ wer of Z@@ o@@ om — you can just zoom around .
This is &quot; &quot; The Am@@ bass@@ ad@@ ors , &quot; &quot; based in the National G@@ all@@ ery .
You can ann@@ ot@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these mas@@ ter@@ pieces .
So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the mus@@ eu@@ ms .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these artists .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it properly online .
And the biggest question I get asked now@@ ad@@ ays is , &quot; &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to suppl@@ ement the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I &apos;m a story@@ tel@@ ler .
That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing nov@@ els — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some super@@ natural creatures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ ni .
But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glim@@ p@@ ses of my personal story .
I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geom@@ etr@@ ical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
I was born in Str@@ as@@ bour@@ g , France to Tur@@ k@@ ish parents .
S@@ hor@@ tly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Tur@@ key with my mom .
From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
Now in the early 197@@ 0s , in An@@ k@@ ar@@ a , that was a bit unusual .
Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of house@@ holds , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divor@@ ce@@ e in a patri@@ arch@@ al environment .
In fact , I grew up obser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ hood .
On the one hand was my mother , a well-@@ educated , sec@@ ular , modern , w@@ ester@@ ni@@ zed , Tur@@ k@@ ish woman .
On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
This was a woman who read coffee gr@@ ounds to see the future and mel@@ ted lead into myster@@ ious shapes to f@@ end off the evil eye .
Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe ac@@ ne on their faces or war@@ ts on their hands .
Each time , my grandmother would ut@@ ter some words in Arab@@ ic , take a red apple and st@@ ab it with as many rose thor@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to remove .
Then one by one , she would en@@ circle these thor@@ ns with dark ink .
A week later , the patient would come back for a fol@@ low-@@ up exam@@ ination .
Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of schol@@ ars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back un@@ happy or un@@ heal@@ ed .
I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of pr@@ aying ?
In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , pr@@ aying is effective , but also be@@ ware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very preci@@ ous lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a bl@@ em@@ ish or the human soul , all you need to do is to surr@@ ound it with thick walls .
It will dry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
We all do .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of dr@@ ying up inside .
Our imagination might shr@@ ink ; our hearts might d@@ wind@@ le , and our hum@@ ann@@ ess might wi@@ ther if we stay for too long inside our cultural co@@ co@@ ons .
Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle res@@ emble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
Now one other thing women like my grand@@ ma do in Tur@@ key is to cover mir@@ rors with vel@@ v@@ et or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time star@@ ing at his own refl@@ ection .
I@@ ron@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the li@@ ke@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s glob@@ alized world .
And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liber@@ als and conserv@@ atives , agno@@ s@@ tics and believ@@ ers , the rich and the poor , East and West ali@@ ke .
We tend to form clu@@ sters based on simil@@ arity , and then we produce stere@@ oty@@ pes about other clu@@ sters of people .
In my opinion , one way of trans@@ c@@ ending these cultural gh@@ et@@ tos is through the art of storytelling .
St@@ ories cannot dem@@ ol@@ ish fronti@@ ers , but they can p@@ unch holes in our mental walls .
And through those holes , we can get a glim@@ pse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ quo@@ ise not@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
In retro@@ sp@@ ect , I think she was slightly worried about my san@@ ity .
I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imagin@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good .
I was an intro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communic@@ ating with colo@@ red cr@@ ayons and apo@@ lo@@ gi@@ zing to objects when I bum@@ ped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day@@ -to-@@ day experiences and emotions .
What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terri@@ bly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
And th@@ us began my life-@@ long passion for writing fiction .
So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an auto@@ bi@@ ograph@@ ical manifestation than a transcend@@ ental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a diplom@@ at .
So from this small , su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tious , midd@@ le-@@ class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zoom@@ ed into this pos@@ h , international school &#91; in Mad@@ rid &#93; , where I was the only Tur@@ k .
It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; represent@@ ative fore@@ ign@@ er . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all nation@@ alities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmo@@ polit@@ an , e@@ gal@@ itarian classroom democracy .
Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the represent@@ ative of something larger .
We were like a mini@@ ature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with regar@@ ds to a nation or a religion , took place .
The child who represented it was mo@@ cked , ridicul@@ ed and bul@@ li@@ ed end@@ lessly .
And I should know , because during the time I attend@@ ed that school , a military ta@@ ke@@ over happened in my country , a g@@ un@@ man of my nation@@ ality nearly killed the P@@ ope , and Tur@@ key got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test .
( Laughter ) I ski@@ pped school often and dre@@ amed of becoming a sai@@ lo@@ r during those days .
I also had my first taste of cultural stere@@ oty@@ pes there .
The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night Ex@@ press , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they inqui@@ red how many cigar@@ ettes a day I smo@@ ked , because they thought all Tur@@ ks were heavy smo@@ kers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
I came to learn that these were the three main stere@@ oty@@ pes about my country : politics , cigar@@ ettes and the ve@@ il .
After Spain , we went to J@@ ord@@ an , Germany and An@@ k@@ ar@@ a again .
Every@@ where I went , I felt like my imagination was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me .
St@@ ories gave me a sense of center , continu@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I otherwise l@@ acked .
In my mid-@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , I moved to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , the city I adore .
I lived in a very vibr@@ ant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my nov@@ els .
I was in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l when the earthquake hit in 1999 .
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
There was the local gro@@ cer there — a gr@@ um@@ p@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcoho@@ l and didn &apos;t speak to margin@@ als .
He was sitting next to a trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and mas@@ car@@ a running down her che@@ eks .
I watched the man open a pack of cigar@@ ettes with trem@@ bling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative gro@@ cer and a crying trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te smoking together on the side@@ walk .
In the face of death and destruction , our mun@@ d@@ ane differences ev@@ apor@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , co@@ zy apart@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ ased against .
S@@ hor@@ tly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Michigan .
I experienced this , not so much as a ge@@ ograph@@ ical shift , as a lingu@@ istic one .
I started writing fiction in English .
I &apos;m not an immigr@@ ant , refugee or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the comm@@ ute between languages gives me the chance to re@@ create myself .
I love writing in Tur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very po@@ e@@ tic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cer@@ ebr@@ al .
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acqui@@ red language .
When you &apos;re a lat@@ e@@ com@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpe@@ tual frustration .
As lat@@ e@@ com@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jo@@ kes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the ton@@ gue .
And that gap is very inti@@ mid@@ ating .
But if we manage not to be frighten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also stimul@@ ating .
And this is what I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very stimul@@ ating .
At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily pr@@ ay@@ ers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get married so that I could set@@ tle down once and for all .
And because God lo@@ ves her , I did get married .
( Laughter ) But instead of sett@@ ling down , I went to Arizona .
And since my husband is in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , I started comm@@ u@@ ting between Arizona and I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
I guess one part of me has always been a nom@@ ad , physically and spiritu@@ ally .
St@@ ories ac@@ company me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an existenti@@ al glu@@ e .
Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting remar@@ k from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic .
&quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , His@@ pan@@ ic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Tur@@ k@@ ish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Tur@@ k@@ ish characters , but I understood what my cri@@ tic was looking for .
And I also understood that I would keep disap@@ pointing him .
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity .
He was looking for a Tur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circul@@ ated , read and re@@ viewed .
Many auth@@ ors feel this pressure , but non-@@ Western auth@@ ors feel it more heav@@ ily .
If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy Muslim women .
You &apos;re expected to write inform@@ ative , poign@@ ant and character@@ istic stories and leave the experimental and avant-@@ garde to your Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a child in that school in Mad@@ rid is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
W@@ r@@ it@@ ers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the represent@@ atives of their resp@@ ective cultures : a few auth@@ ors from China , a few from Tur@@ key , a few from Nigeria .
We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinc@@ tive , if not pec@@ uli@@ ar .
The writer and comm@@ u@@ ter James Bal@@ d@@ win gave an interview in 1984 in which he was repe@@ at@@ edly asked about his homosexu@@ ality .
When the intervie@@ wer tried to pige@@ on@@ hole him as a gay writer , Bal@@ d@@ win stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put lab@@ els on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
There &apos;s a fu@@ zz@@ y category called multi@@ cultural literature in which all auth@@ ors from outside the Western world are l@@ um@@ ped together .
I never forget my first multi@@ cultural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
We were three writers , one from the Phili@@ pp@@ ines , one Tur@@ k@@ ish and one Indon@@ es@@ ian — like a joke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a liter@@ ary taste .
It was only because of our pass@@ ports .
M@@ ul@@ ti@@ cultural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imagin@@ ary .
A function is attribu@@ ted to fiction .
In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fic@@ tional characters become the represent@@ atives of something larger .
But I must quickly add that this tend@@ ency to see a story as more than a story does not sol@@ ely come from the West .
It comes from everywhere .
And I experienced this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fic@@ tional characters ut@@ tered in a novel .
I had intended to write a construc@@ tive , multi-@@ lay@@ ered novel about an Ar@@ men@@ ian and a Tur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women .
My micro story became a mac@@ ro issue when I was pro@@ sec@@ u@@ ted .
Some people cri@@ tici@@ zed , others pr@@ ais@@ ed me for writing about the Tur@@ k@@ ish@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ ian conflict .
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
It was just a story .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to bel@@ it@@ tle my work .
I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
W@@ r@@ it@@ ers are enti@@ tled to their political opinions , and there are good political nov@@ els out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
Che@@ k@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely separate things .
And only the lat@@ ter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; I@@ denti@@ ty politics divi@@ des us . F@@ ic@@ tion conn@@ ects .
One is interested in s@@ wee@@ ping gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
The other , in nu@@ ances .
One dra@@ ws boundaries .
The other recogni@@ zes no fronti@@ ers .
I@@ denti@@ ty politics is made of solid bric@@ ks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flowing water .
In the O@@ t@@ tom@@ an times , there were it@@ iner@@ ant story@@ t@@ ell@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ dd@@ ah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvis@@ ing .
With each new person in the story , the me@@ dd@@ ah would change his voice , im@@ person@@ ating that character .
Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sul@@ tan , Muslims and non-@@ Muslims .
St@@ ories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ ales of N@@ as@@ re@@ dd@@ in H@@ od@@ ja , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Bal@@ k@@ ans and Asia .
Today , stories continue to trans@@ cen@@ d borders .
When Palestin@@ ian and Israel@@ i politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestin@@ ian read@@ er still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice vers@@ a , connecting and empath@@ izing with the narr@@ ator .
L@@ iter@@ ature has to take us beyond .
If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
B@@ oo@@ ks have saved the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that I was — that I once was .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ izing them .
When the poet and my@@ stic , R@@ um@@ i , met his spiritual compan@@ ion , Sh@@ ams of T@@ ab@@ riz , one of the first things the lat@@ ter did was to to@@ ss R@@ um@@ i &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dis@@ solve .
The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ now@@ le@@ dge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural gh@@ et@@ tos is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us eli@@ ti@@ st , distant and dis@@ connected .
There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing compas@@ s .
As you know , one leg of the compas@@ s is static , ro@@ oted in a place .
Me@@ an@@ while , the other leg dra@@ ws a wide circle , constantly moving .
Like that , my fiction as well .
One part of it is ro@@ oted in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , with strong Tur@@ k@@ ish roots , but the other part trav@@ els the world , connecting to different cultures .
In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
Now those of you who have been to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ k@@ ap@@ i Pal@@ ace , which was the res@@ id@@ ence of O@@ t@@ tom@@ an sul@@ t@@ ans for more than 400 years .
In the pal@@ ace , just outside the quarters of the favorite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The G@@ a@@ ther@@ ing Pl@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n .
It &apos;s between buildings .
I &apos;m intrigu@@ ed by this concept .
We usually dis@@ trust those areas that fall in between things .
We see them as the domain of super@@ natural creatures like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of smo@@ k@@ eless fire and are the symbol of el@@ u@@ si@@ veness .
But my point is perhaps that el@@ u@@ sive space is what writers and artists need most .
When I write fiction I cher@@ ish el@@ u@@ si@@ veness and change@@ ability .
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a hand@@ some , gay professor in Norway .
As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
Au@@ dre L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
Imag@@ in@@ ative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
We should get out of our cultural gh@@ et@@ to and go visit the next one and the next .
In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vis@@ hes , drawing circles beyond circles .
They connect all humanity , regard@@ less of identity politics , and that is the good news .
And I would like to finish with an old Su@@ fi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lo@@ vers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m Jane Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game designer .
We do achieve more in game worlds .
So , so far , collec@@ tively all the World of War@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of A@@ zer@@ oth .
Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more collaborative and hear@@ ty species .
And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
Five million people use it every month .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
His work is brilliant .
But it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
Before we had awesome game controll@@ ers , we had sheep &apos;s k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les .
People were suffering . People were fighting .
This is really exciting .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
We want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
We made this game in 2007 .
This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got lev@@ eling up in skills like local insight , knowledge net@@ working , sustainability , vision and res@@ our@@ ce@@ fulness .
The &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; cre@@ w and I were called to a little town in Col@@ or@@ ado , called Craig .
It &apos;s only a couple dozen square miles . It &apos;s in the Roc@@ k@@ ies .
And the job in question was sheep ran@@ cher .
My role on the show , for those of you who haven &apos;t seen it — it &apos;s pretty simple .
I &apos;m an appr@@ enti@@ ce , and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
And my responsi@@ bil@@ ities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it &apos;s like to be these people , for one day in their life .
The job in question : her@@ ding sheep . Great .
We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that cas@@ tr@@ ation is going to be an absolute part of this work .
So , normally , I never do any research at all .
But , this is a touch@@ y subject , and I work for the Dis@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ nel , and we want to por@@ tr@@ ay accur@@ ately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
So I called the Hum@@ ane Soci@@ ety and I say , &quot; &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to be cas@@ tr@@ ating some lam@@ bs , Can you tell me the deal ? &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty strai@@ ght@@ forward . &quot; &quot; They use a band — basically a rub@@ ber band , like this , only a little smaller .
This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday , but it had a certain famili@@ arity to it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what exactly is the process ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; The band is applied to the tail , ti@@ ghtly .
And then another band is applied to the scr@@ ot@@ um , ti@@ ghtly .
B@@ loo@@ d flow is slowly ret@@ ar@@ ded ; a week later the parts in question fall off .
&quot; Great — got it . &quot;
OK , I call the S@@ P@@ CA to confir@@ m this — they confir@@ m it .
I also call PE@@ T@@ A , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it — but they confir@@ m it .
OK , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
So the next day I go out .
And I &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lam@@ bs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
Mel@@ an@@ ie is the wife of Albert .
Albert is the she@@ pher@@ d in question .
Mel@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up the lam@@ b — two hands — one hand on both legs on the right , li@@ ke@@ wise on the left .
L@@ am@@ b goes on the post , she opens it up .
Al@@ right . Great .
Albert goes in , I follow Albert , the cre@@ w is around .
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it .
Be@@ ing an appr@@ enti@@ ce , you know , you do that .
Albert re@@ aches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rub@@ ber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
And I &apos;m like that &apos;s not rub@@ ber at all , you know .
And he kind of f@@ lic@@ ked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Roc@@ k@@ ies , it was very — it was , it was impres@@ sive .
In the space of about two seconds , Albert had the knife between the car@@ til@@ age of the tail , right next to the but@@ t of the lam@@ b , and very quickly the tail was gone and in the buc@@ ket that I was holding .
A second later , with a big thum@@ b and a well call@@ ous@@ ed fore@@ finger , he had the scr@@ ot@@ um fir@@ m@@ ly in his gras@@ p .
And he pulled it toward him , like so , and he took the knife and he put it on the tip .
Now you think you know what &apos;s coming , Michael — you don &apos;t , OK ?
He sni@@ ps it , thro@@ ws the tip over his shoulder , and then gr@@ abs the scr@@ ot@@ um and push@@ es it up@@ ward , and then his head di@@ ps down , obsc@@ ur@@ ing my view , but what I hear is a sl@@ ur@@ ping sound , and a noise that sounds like V@@ el@@ cr@@ o being y@@ an@@ ked off a stic@@ ky wall and I am not even kid@@ ding .
Can we roll the video ?
No I &apos;m kid@@ ding — we don &apos;t — ( Laughter ) I thought it best to talk in pictures .
So , I do something now I &apos;ve never ever done on a &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; shoot , ever .
I say , &quot; &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot; &quot; You guys know the show , we use take one , we don &apos;t do take two .
There &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no scri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no non@@ sense .
We don &apos;t fo@@ ol around , we don &apos;t re@@ hear@@ se — we shoot what we get !
I said , &quot; &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot; &quot; I mean , you know .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; This is crazy .
We can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; And Albert &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what just happened , but there are tes@@ tic@@ les in this buc@@ ket and that &apos;s not how we do it . &quot; &quot; And he said &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how we do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why would you do it this way ? &quot; &quot; And before I even let him explain , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do it the right way , with the rub@@ ber ban@@ ds . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Like the Hum@@ ane Soci@@ ety ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , like the Hum@@ ane Soci@@ ety .
Let &apos;s do something that doesn &apos;t make the lam@@ b squ@@ e@@ al and ble@@ ed — we &apos;re on in five continents , du@@ de .
We &apos;re on twice a day on the Dis@@ co@@ very Ch@@ an@@ nel — we can &apos;t do this . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; He goes to his box and he pul@@ ls out a bag of these little rub@@ ber ban@@ ds .
Mel@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up another lam@@ b , puts it on the post , band goes on the tail , band goes on the scr@@ ot@@ um .
L@@ am@@ b goes on the ground , lam@@ b takes two steps , falls down , gets up , sh@@ akes a little , takes another couple steps , falls down .
I &apos;m like , this is not a good sign for this lam@@ b , at all .
G@@ ets up , walks to the corner , it &apos;s qui@@ vering , and it lies down and it &apos;s in obvious distr@@ ess .
And I &apos;m looking at the lam@@ b and I say , &quot; &quot; Albert , how long ?
When does he get up ? &quot; &quot; He &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; A day . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; A day ! How long does it take them to fall off ? &quot; &quot; &quot; A week . &quot;
Me@@ an@@ while , the lam@@ b that he had just did his little proce@@ dure on is , you know , he &apos;s just pr@@ ancing around , ble@@ eding stopped .
He &apos;s , you know , ni@@ b@@ bling on some grass , fro@@ lic@@ king .
And I was just so blo@@ wn away at how wrong I was , in that second .
And I was reminded how utter@@ ly wrong I am , so much of the time .
( Laughter ) And I was especially reminded of what an ridicul@@ ously short str@@ aw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done , and there are like 100 of these lam@@ bs in the pen , and suddenly this whole thing &apos;s starting to feel like a German por@@ no , and I &apos;m like ... ( Laughter ) Mel@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up the lam@@ b , puts it on the post , opens it up .
Albert hands me the knife .
I go in , tail comes off .
I go in , I grab the scr@@ ot@@ um , tip comes off .
Albert instruc@@ ts , &quot; &quot; P@@ ush it way up there . &quot; &quot; I do .
&quot; P@@ ush it further . &quot;
I do .
The tes@@ tic@@ les emerge — they look like thum@@ bs , coming right at you — and he says , &quot; &quot; B@@ ite &apos; em .
Just b@@ ite &apos; em off . &quot; &quot; And I heard him , I heard all the words .
( Laughter ) Like , how did — how did I get here ?
How did — you know — I mean — how did I get here ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — it &apos;s one of those moments where the brain goes off on it &apos;s own : and suddenly , I &apos;m standing there , in the Roc@@ k@@ ies , and all I can think of is the Arist@@ ot@@ eli@@ an definition of a tragedy .
You know , Arist@@ ot@@ le says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; What is this jac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up metaphor ?
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m thinking right now . &quot; &quot; And I can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and I can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so I did what I had to do .
I went in and I took them .
I took them like this , and I y@@ an@@ ked my face back .
And I &apos;m standing there with two tes@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) And now I can &apos;t get — I can &apos;t shake the metaphor .
OK , I &apos;m still in &quot; &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics , &quot; &quot; in Arist@@ ot@@ le , and I &apos;m thinking — out of nowhere , two terms come crash@@ ing into my head that I haven &apos;t heard since my class@@ ics professor in college dr@@ illed them there .
And they are an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ p@@ et@@ e@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ p@@ et@@ e@@ ia .
An@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the Greek word for discovery .
L@@ iter@@ ally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is .
It &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; is .
And I &apos;m up to my neck in an@@ ag@@ nor@@ ises every single day .
Great .
The other word , peri@@ p@@ et@@ e@@ ia , that &apos;s the moment in the great trage@@ dies , you know — Eu@@ ri@@ pi@@ des and S@@ oph@@ oc@@ les — the moment where O@@ e@@ di@@ pus has his moment , where he suddenly realiz@@ es that hot ch@@ ick he &apos;s been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother . OK .
That &apos;s peri@@ p@@ ety or peri@@ p@@ et@@ e@@ ia .
And this metaphor in my head — I got an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is and peri@@ peti@@ a on my ch@@ in .
( Laughter ) I got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
When you start to look for peri@@ peti@@ a , you find it everywhere .
I mean , Bru@@ ce W@@ ill@@ is in &quot; &quot; The Si@@ x@@ th S@@ ense , &quot; &quot; right ?
S@@ pend@@ s the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people , and then , boom — &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m dead &quot; &quot; — peri@@ peti@@ a .
You know ?
It &apos;s cr@@ ush@@ ing when the audience sees it the right way .
Ne@@ o in &quot; &quot; The M@@ atri@@ x , &quot; &quot; you know ?
&quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s weird .
These discoveries that lead to sudden realiz@@ ations ; and I &apos;ve been having them , over 200 dirty jobs , I have them all the time , but that one — that one dr@@ illed something home in a way that I just wasn &apos;t prepared for .
And , as I stood there , looking at the happy lam@@ b that I had just de@@ fil@@ ed — but it looked OK .
Loo@@ king at that poor other little thing that I &apos;d done it the right way on , and I just was struck by if I &apos;m wrong about that and if I &apos;m wrong so often , in a liter@@ al way , what other peri@@ pat@@ e@@ tic mis@@ concep@@ tions might I be able to comment upon ?
Because , look , I &apos;m not a social anthropo@@ logist but I have a friend who is .
And I talk to him .
( Laughter ) And he says , &quot; &quot; Hey Mike .
Look , I don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
You &apos;ve worked in mining , you &apos;ve worked in fishing , you &apos;ve worked in steel , you &apos;ve worked in every major industry .
You &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desper@@ ate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot; &quot; I can still see H@@ ill@@ ary doing the shots of ry@@ e , dri@@ b@@ bling down her ch@@ in , with the steel workers .
I mean , these are the people that I work with every single day .
&quot; &quot; And if you have something to say about their thoughts , collec@@ tively , it might be time to think about it .
Because , du@@ de , you know , four years . &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s in my head , tes@@ tic@@ les are on my ch@@ in , thoughts are b@@ ounc@@ ing around .
And , after that shoot , D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
And now , when I talk about the show , I no longer just tell the story you heard and 19@@ 0 like it .
I do , but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong , some of the other no@@ tions of work that I &apos;ve just been assum@@ ing are s@@ acro@@ sanc@@ t , and they &apos;re not .
People with dirty jobs are happ@@ ier than you think .
As a group , they &apos;re the happ@@ iest people I know .
And I don &apos;t want to start whist@@ ling &quot; &quot; Look for the Union L@@ ab@@ el , &quot; &quot; and all that happy worker cr@@ ap .
I &apos;m just telling you that these are bal@@ anced people who do un@@ thin@@ k@@ able work .
Ro@@ ad@@ kill pic@@ k@@ er-@@ up@@ pers whist@@ le while they work . I sw@@ ear to God — I did it with them .
They &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
And I see it over and over and over again .
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challeng@@ ed some of these sacred co@@ ws .
F@@ ol@@ low your passion — we &apos;ve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours .
F@@ ol@@ low your passion — what could possibly be wrong with that ?
Probab@@ ly the worst advice I ever got .
( Laughter ) You know , follow your dreams and go broke , right ?
I mean , that &apos;s all I heard growing up .
I didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but I was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
I can give you 30 examples , right now — Bob C@@ omb@@ s , the pig farmer in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as who coll@@ ects the un@@ eaten scr@@ aps of food from the cas@@ in@@ os and fe@@ eds them them to his sw@@ ine .
Why ? Because there &apos;s so much protein in the stuff we don &apos;t eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed , and he is one rich pig farmer , and he is good for the environment , and he sp@@ ends his days doing this incredible service , and he sm@@ ells like hell , but God bl@@ ess him .
He &apos;s making a great living .
You ask him , &quot; &quot; Did you follow your passion here ? &quot; &quot; and he &apos;d laugh at you .
The guy &apos;s worth — he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down , outside of V@@ eg@@ as .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
He ste@@ pped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
And I hear that story over and over .
Matt Fro@@ ind , a dai@@ ry farmer in New Can@@ a@@ an , Conn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut , who w@@ oke up one day and realized the cr@@ ap from his co@@ ws was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these bio@@ degrad@@ able flower po@@ ts .
Now , he &apos;s selling them to Wal@@ mart .
F@@ ol@@ low his passion ? The guy &apos;s — come on .
So I started to look at passion , I started to look at efficiency versus effec@@ ti@@ veness — as Tim talked about earlier , that &apos;s a huge distinction .
I started to look at te@@ am@@ work and determin@@ ation , and basically all those pl@@ ati@@ tu@@ des they call &quot; &quot; success@@ ories &quot; &quot; that hang with that sch@@ mal@@ t@@ zy art in bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms around the world right now .
That stuff — it &apos;s suddenly all been turned on its head .
S@@ af@@ ety — safety first ?
Go@@ ing back to , you know , O@@ S@@ H@@ A and PE@@ T@@ A and the Hum@@ ane Soci@@ ety : what if O@@ S@@ H@@ A got it wrong ?
I mean — this is her@@ es@@ y , what I &apos;m about to say — but what if it &apos;s really safety third ?
Right ?
( Laughter ) No , I mean really .
What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
They know that other things come first — the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
And I &apos;ll never forget , up in the B@@ ering Sea , I was on a cr@@ ab boat with the &quot; &quot; D@@ ea@@ d@@ liest C@@ atch &quot; &quot; guys — which I also work on — in the first season .
We &apos;re about 100 miles off the coast of Russia : 5@@ 0-@@ foot seas , big waves , green water coming over the wheel@@ house , right ?
Most h@@ az@@ ard@@ ous environment I &apos;d ever seen , and I was back with a guy , l@@ ash@@ ing the po@@ ts down .
So , I &apos;m 40 feet off the dec@@ k , which is like looking down at the top of your sho@@ e , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
Un@@ spea@@ k@@ ably dangerous .
I sc@@ am@@ per down , I go into the wheel@@ house and I say , with some level of incre@@ dul@@ ity , &quot; Cap@@ tain , O@@ S@@ H@@ A . &quot;
And he says , &quot; &quot; O@@ S@@ H@@ A ? Ocean . &quot; &quot; And he points out there .
( Laughter ) But in that moment , what he said next can &apos;t be repe@@ ated in the lower 48 .
It can &apos;t be repe@@ ated on any factory floor or any construction site .
But he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Son &quot; &quot; — he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , I love that — he says , &quot; &quot; Son , I &apos;m a cap@@ tain of a cr@@ ab boat .
My responsibility is not to get you home alive .
My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You want to get home alive , that &apos;s on you .
And for the rest of that day , safety first .
I was like — So , the idea that we create this false — this sense of compl@@ ac@@ ency when all we do is talk about somebody else &apos;s responsibility as though it &apos;s our own , and vice vers@@ a .
Any@@ how , a whole lot of things .
I could talk at length about the many little distinc@@ tions we made and the end@@ less list of ways that I got it wrong .
But , what it all comes down to is this .
I formed a theory , and I &apos;m going to share it now in my remain@@ ing two minutes and 30 seconds .
It goes like this — we &apos;ve dec@@ lar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , really .
We didn &apos;t set out to do it and we didn &apos;t tw@@ ist our mu@@ st@@ ache in some M@@ achi@@ av@@ el@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it .
And we &apos;ve w@@ aged this war on at least four fron@@ ts , certainly in Hollywood .
The way we por@@ tr@@ ay working people on TV — it &apos;s laugh@@ able .
If there &apos;s a pl@@ um@@ ber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant but@@ t crack . Ad@@ mit it .
You see him all the time .
That &apos;s what pl@@ um@@ bers look like , right ?
We turn them into heroes , or we turn them into p@@ unch lines .
That &apos;s what TV does .
We try hard on &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; not to do that , which is why I do the work and I don &apos;t che@@ at .
But , we &apos;ve w@@ aged this war on Ma@@ dis@@ on A@@ venue .
I mean , so many of the commerci@@ als that come out there — in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
Your life would be better if you could work a little less , if you didn &apos;t have to work so hard , if you could get home a little earlier , if you could reti@@ re a little faster , if you could p@@ unch out a little so@@ oner — it &apos;s all in there , over and over , again and again .
Washington ? I can &apos;t even begin to talk about the de@@ als and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don &apos;t really know .
I just know that that &apos;s a front in this war .
And right here guys , Silicon Valley , I mean — how many people have an iPhone on them right now ?
How many people have their Black@@ ber@@ ries ?
We &apos;re plu@@ gged in ; we &apos;re connected .
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution .
Good gri@@ ef , not to this crowd .
( Laughter ) But I would suggest that innovation without im@@ itation is a complete waste of time .
And nobody celebr@@ ates im@@ itation the way &quot; &quot; D@@ ir@@ ty J@@ obs &quot; &quot; guys know it has to be done .
Your iPhone without those people making the same interface , the same circu@@ i@@ try , the same board , over and over ?
All of that ? That &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
So , we &apos;ve got this new to@@ ol@@ box , you know .
Our tools today don &apos;t look like sho@@ v@@ els and pic@@ ks .
They look like the stuff we walk around with .
And so the collective effect of all of that has been this margin@@ alization of lots and lots of jobs .
And I realized , probably too late in this game — I hope not , because I don &apos;t know if I can do 200 more of these things — but we &apos;re going to do as many as we can .
And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the tes@@ tic@@ les on my ch@@ in .
I got a lot wrong .
So , we &apos;re thinking — by we , I mean me — that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work , manu@@ al labor , sk@@ illed labor .
Some@@ body needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits .
I &apos;m talking about grandfather stuff , the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we &apos;ve kind of — you know , kind of lost a little .
Bar@@ ack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
The infrastructure is a huge deal .
This war on work , that I suppose exists , has ca@@ su@@ al@@ ties like any other war .
The infrastructure &apos;s the first one ; dec@@ lin@@ ing tra@@ de-@@ school en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ments are the second one .
Every single year : fewer electr@@ icians , fewer car@@ pen@@ ters , fewer pl@@ um@@ bers , fewer wel@@ ders , fewer pi@@ pe@@ f@@ it@@ ters , fewer ste@@ am@@ f@@ it@@ ters .
The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys — the ones that have been in decline , over and over .
Me@@ an@@ while , we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars — at a minimum , according to the American Soci@@ ety of Ci@@ vi@@ l En@@ g@@ ine@@ ers — that we need to ex@@ pend to even make a dent in the infrastructure , which is currently r@@ ated at a D min@@ us .
So , if I were running for anything , and I &apos;m not , I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren &apos;t going to stick unless they &apos;re jobs that people want .
And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and d@@ ear to us , but I also know that clean and dirty aren &apos;t oppos@@ ites .
They &apos;re two sides of the same coin , just like innovation and im@@ itation , like risk and responsibility , like peri@@ peti@@ a and an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is , like that poor little lam@@ b , who I hope isn &apos;t qui@@ vering anymore , and like my time that &apos;s gone .
It &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
( Applause )
My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dorm@@ ant inside us .
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of sle@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ priv@@ ed women .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
Tw@@ o-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years ago , I f@@ ain@@ ted from ex@@ haus@@ tion .
I hit my head on my desk . I broke my che@@ e@@ k@@ bone , I got five sti@@ t@@ ches on my right eye .
And I began the journey of re@@ discovering the value of sleep .
And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joy@@ ful life is getting enough sleep .
( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new femin@@ ist issue .
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep de@@ priv@@ ation has become a vir@@ ility symbol .
I was recently having dinner with a guy who br@@ ag@@ ged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep de@@ priv@@ ation one-@@ up@@ man@@ ship .
E@@ spec@@ ially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;@@ clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;@@ clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
So a high I.@@ Q@@ .
does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Tit@@ anic .
And we &apos;ve had far too many ice@@ ber@@ gs hitting our Tit@@ an@@ ics .
In fact , I have a feeling that if Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers and S@@ is@@ ters , they might still be around .
( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper@@ -@@ connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have wo@@ ken up from a sev@@ en-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ - or ei@@ ght-@@ hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , grati@@ tude , effec@@ ti@@ veness in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world .
So I ur@@ ge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your eng@@ ines and discover the power of sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , as Chris pointed out , I study the human brain , the functions and structure of the human brain .
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this ent@@ ails .
Here is this mass of j@@ elly , three-@@ pound mass of j@@ elly you can hold in the pal@@ m of your hand , and it can contempl@@ ate the vas@@ t@@ ness of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space .
It can contempl@@ ate the meaning of infin@@ ity and it can contempl@@ ate itself contempl@@ ating on the meaning of infin@@ ity .
And this pec@@ uli@@ ar rec@@ ur@@ sive quality that we call self-@@ awareness , which I think is the ho@@ ly gr@@ ail of neuroscience , of neuro@@ logy , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
OK , so how do you study this myster@@ ious organ ?
I mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wis@@ ps of proto@@ plas@@ m , interacting with each other , and from this activity emer@@ ges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness .
How does this happen ?
Well , there are many ways of approach@@ ing the functions of the human brain .
One approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sust@@ ained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
What then happens is not an acro@@ ss@@ -@@ the-@@ board reduction in all your mental capac@@ ities , a sort of bl@@ un@@ ting of your cognitive ability .
What you get is a highly sel@@ ective loss of one function , with other functions being preser@@ ved intact , and this gives you some confidence in ass@@ er@@ ting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in medi@@ ating that function .
So you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circu@@ i@@ try &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So let me give you a few stri@@ king examples of this .
In fact , I &apos;m giving you three examples , six minutes each , during this talk .
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Cap@@ gras syndrome .
If you look at the first slide there , that &apos;s the tempor@@ al lo@@ bes , frontal lo@@ bes , par@@ i@@ et@@ al lo@@ bes , OK — the lo@@ bes that constitu@@ te the brain .
And if you look , tu@@ cked away inside the inner surface of the tempor@@ al lo@@ bes — you can &apos;t see it there — is a little structure called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us .
And that &apos;s been called the face area in the brain , because when it &apos;s dam@@ aged , you can no longer recognize people &apos;s faces .
You can still recognize them from their voice and say , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , that &apos;s Joe , &quot; &quot; but you can &apos;t look at their face and know who it is , right ?
You can &apos;t even recognize yourself in the mirror .
I mean , you know it &apos;s you because you win@@ k and it win@@ ks , and you know it &apos;s a mirror , but you don &apos;t really recognize yourself as yourself .
OK . Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us .
But there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physici@@ ans have heard about it , not even neuro@@ logists .
This is called the Cap@@ gras del@@ usion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of com@@ a , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; &quot; This looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impos@@ tor .
She &apos;s some other woman pret@@ ending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; Now , why does this happen ?
Why would somebody — and this person is perfectly luci@@ d and intelligent in all other resp@@ ects , but when he sees his mother , his del@@ usion k@@ ic@@ ks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
Now , the most common interpret@@ ation of this , which you find in all the psychi@@ a@@ try text@@ books , is a F@@ reu@@ di@@ an view , and that is that this cha@@ p — and the same argument appl@@ ies to women , by the way , but I &apos;ll just talk about guys .
When you &apos;re a little baby , a young baby , you had a strong sexual attr@@ action to your mother .
This is the so-called O@@ e@@ di@@ pus complex of F@@ reu@@ d .
I &apos;m not saying I believe this , but this is the standard F@@ reu@@ di@@ an view .
And then , as you grow up , the cortex develop@@ s , and inhi@@ bits these lat@@ ent sexual ur@@ ges towards your mother .
Thank God , or you would all be sexu@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother .
And then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , dam@@ aging the cortex , allowing these lat@@ ent sexual ur@@ ges to emerge , fl@@ aming to the surface , and suddenly and in@@ explic@@ ably you find yourself being sexu@@ ally ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother .
And you say , &quot; &quot; My God , if this is my mom , how come I &apos;m being sexu@@ ally turned on ?
She &apos;s some other woman . She &apos;s an impos@@ tor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the only interpret@@ ation that makes sense to your dam@@ aged brain .
This has never made much sense to me , this argument .
It &apos;s very in@@ gen@@ ious , as all F@@ reu@@ di@@ an arguments are — ( Laughter ) — but didn &apos;t make much sense because I have seen the same del@@ usion , a patient having the same del@@ usion , about his pet po@@ od@@ le . ( Laughter )
He &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Doc@@ tor , this is not Fi@@ fi . It looks exactly like Fi@@ fi , but it &apos;s some other dog . &quot; &quot; Right ?
Now , you try using the F@@ reu@@ di@@ an explanation there .
( Laughter ) You &apos;ll start talking about the lat@@ ent bes@@ ti@@ ality in all humans , or some such thing , which is quite absur@@ d , of course .
Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
So , to explain this curious disorder , we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual path@@ ways in the brain .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , visual signals come in , into the ey@@ e@@ balls , go to the visual areas in the brain .
There are , in fact , 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision , and after processing all that , the message goes to a small structure called the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , where you perceive faces .
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
You can call it the face area of the brain , right ?
I talked about that earlier .
Now , when that area &apos;s dam@@ aged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
But from that area , the message casc@@ ades into a structure called the am@@ yg@@ d@@ ala in the lim@@ bic system , the emotional core of the brain , and that structure , called the am@@ yg@@ d@@ ala , g@@ aug@@ es the emotional signific@@ ance of what you &apos;re looking at .
Is it pre@@ y ? Is it predat@@ or ? Is it mate ?
Or is it something absolutely trivial , like a piece of lin@@ t , or a piece of chal@@ k , or a — I don &apos;t want to point to that , but — or a sho@@ e , or something like that ? OK ?
Which you can completely ignore .
So if the am@@ yg@@ d@@ ala is excited , and this is something important , the messages then casc@@ ade into the autonom@@ ic nervous system .
Your heart starts be@@ ating faster .
You start swe@@ ating to dissi@@ p@@ ate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cular exer@@ tion .
And that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electro@@ des on your pal@@ m and measure the change in skin resistance produced by swe@@ ating .
So I can determine , when you &apos;re looking at something , whether you &apos;re excited or whether you &apos;re ar@@ ous@@ ed , or not , OK ?
And I &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
So my idea was , when this cha@@ p looks at an object , when he looks at his — any object for that matter , it goes to the visual areas and , however , and it &apos;s proc@@ essed in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us , and you recognize it as a pe@@ a plant , or a table , or your mother , for that matter , OK ?
And then the message casc@@ ades into the am@@ yg@@ d@@ ala , and then goes down the autonom@@ ic nervous system .
But maybe , in this cha@@ p , that wire that goes from the am@@ yg@@ d@@ ala to the lim@@ bic system , the emotional core of the brain , is cut by the accident .
So because the fu@@ si@@ form is intact , the cha@@ p can still recognize his mother , and says , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , this looks like my mother . &quot; &quot; But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers , he says , &quot; &quot; But how come , if it &apos;s my mother , I don &apos;t experience a warm@@ th ? &quot; &quot; Or terror , as the case may be ? Right ?
( Laughter ) And therefore , he says , &quot; &quot; How do I account for this in@@ explic@@ able lack of emotions ?
This can &apos;t be my mother .
It &apos;s some strange woman pret@@ ending to be my mother . &quot; &quot; How do you test this ?
Well , what you do is , if you take any one of you here , and put you in front of a screen , and measure your gal@@ van@@ ic skin response , and show pictures on the screen , I can measure how you swe@@ at when you see an object , like a table or an umb@@ rel@@ la . Of course , you don &apos;t swe@@ at .
If I show you a picture of a lion , or a ti@@ ger , or a pin@@ up , you start swe@@ ating , right ?
And , believe it or not , if I show you a picture of your mother — I &apos;m talking about normal people — you start swe@@ ating .
You don &apos;t even have to be Jewish .
( Laughter ) Now , what happens if you show this patient ?
You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his gal@@ van@@ ic skin response .
T@@ ables and chairs and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the gal@@ van@@ ic skin response is flat .
There &apos;s no emotional reaction to his mother , because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut .
So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth — but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this del@@ usion that his mother is an impos@@ tor .
It &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seem@@ ingly in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible , neural psychiatri@@ c syndrome and say that the standard F@@ reu@@ di@@ an view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatom@@ y of the brain .
By the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an ad@@ jac@@ ent room — phones him — and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; &quot; Wow , mom , how are you ? Where are you ? &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no del@@ usion through the phone .
Then , she approaches him after an hour , he says , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
You look just like my mother . &quot; &quot; OK ?
The reason is there &apos;s a separate path@@ way going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers , and that &apos;s not been cut by the accident .
So this explains why through the phone he recogni@@ zes his mother , no problem .
When he sees her in person , he says it &apos;s an impos@@ tor .
OK , how is all this complex circu@@ i@@ try set up in the brain ?
Is it nature , genes , or is it nur@@ ture ?
And we approach this problem by consi@@ dering another curious syndrome called ph@@ an@@ tom limb .
And you all know what a ph@@ an@@ tom limb is .
When an arm is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , or a leg is am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , for gan@@ gren@@ e , or you lose it in war — for example , in the Iraq war , it &apos;s now a serious problem — you continue to vivi@@ dly feel the presence of that missing arm , and that &apos;s called a ph@@ an@@ tom arm or a ph@@ an@@ tom leg .
In fact , you can get a ph@@ an@@ tom with almost any part of the body .
B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , even with internal vis@@ cer@@ a .
I &apos;ve had patients with the u@@ ter@@ us removed — hy@@ ster@@ ect@@ om@@ y — who have a ph@@ an@@ tom u@@ ter@@ us , including ph@@ an@@ tom men@@ stru@@ al cr@@ am@@ ps at the appropriate time of the month .
And in fact , one student asked me the other day , &quot; Do they get ph@@ an@@ tom P@@ MS ? &quot;
( Laughter ) A subject ri@@ pe for scientific enqu@@ ir@@ y , but we haven &apos;t pursu@@ ed that .
OK , now the next question is , what can you learn about ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs by doing experiments ?
One of the things we &apos;ve found was , about half the patients with ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs claim that they can move the ph@@ an@@ tom .
It &apos;ll p@@ at his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wave good@@ bye .
These are very compelling , vivi@@ d sens@@ ations .
The patient &apos;s not del@@ u@@ sional .
He knows that the arm is not there , but , n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
But however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
The ph@@ an@@ tom limb — they &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; But doctor , the ph@@ an@@ tom limb is paraly@@ zed .
It &apos;s fixed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cruci@@ at@@ ingly painful .
If only I could move it , maybe the pain will be reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; Now , why would a ph@@ an@@ tom limb be paraly@@ zed ?
It sounds like an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
But when we were looking at the case sheets , what we found was , these people with the paraly@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom lim@@ bs , the original arm was paraly@@ zed because of the peri@@ pher@@ al nerve injury .
The actual nerve suppl@@ ying the arm was sever@@ ed , was cut , by say , a motor@@ cycle accident .
So the patient had an actual arm , which is painful , in a s@@ ling for a few months or a year , and then , in a mis@@ gu@@ ided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm , the surgeon am@@ pu@@ tat@@ es the arm , and then you get a ph@@ an@@ tom arm with the same p@@ ains , right ?
And this is a serious clinical problem .
P@@ ati@@ ents become depressed .
Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
So , how do you treat this syndrome ?
Now , why do you get a paraly@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom limb ?
When I looked at the case sheet , I found that they had an actual arm , and the ner@@ ves suppl@@ ying the arm had been cut , and the actual arm had been paraly@@ zed , and lying in a s@@ ling for several months before the am@@ putation , and this pain then gets carried over into the ph@@ an@@ tom itself .
Why does this happen ?
When the arm was intact , but paraly@@ zed , the brain s@@ ends comm@@ ands to the arm , the front of the brain , saying , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve , &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s getting visual feedback saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No . Mo@@ ve . No .
And this gets wired into the circu@@ i@@ try of the brain , and we call this learned paraly@@ sis , OK ?
The brain lear@@ ns , because of this He@@ b@@ bi@@ an , associ@@ ative link , that the m@@ ere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paraly@@ zed arm .
And then , when you &apos;ve am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated the arm , this learned paraly@@ sis car@@ ries over into your body image and into your ph@@ an@@ tom , OK ?
Now , how do you help these patients ?
How do you un@@ learn the learned paraly@@ sis , so you can reli@@ eve him of this ex@@ cruci@@ ating , cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m of the ph@@ an@@ tom arm ?
Well , we said , what if you now send the command to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his command , right ?
Maybe you can reli@@ eve the ph@@ an@@ tom pain , the ph@@ an@@ tom cr@@ am@@ p .
How do you do that ? Well , virtual reality .
But that costs millions of dollars .
So , I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars , but don &apos;t tell my funding agencies .
( Laughter ) OK ? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box .
You have a car@@ d@@ board box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the ph@@ an@@ tom — so my first patient , Derek , came in .
He had his arm am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated 10 years ago .
He had a br@@ ach@@ ial av@@ ul@@ sion , so the ner@@ ves were cut and the arm was paraly@@ zed , lying in a s@@ ling for a year , and then the arm was am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated .
He had a ph@@ an@@ tom arm , ex@@ cruci@@ at@@ ingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
It was a paraly@@ zed ph@@ an@@ tom arm .
So he came there , and I gave him a mirror like that , in a box , which I call a mirror box , right ?
And the patient puts his ph@@ an@@ tom left arm , which is cl@@ en@@ ched and in sp@@ as@@ m , on the left side of the mirror , and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror , and makes the same pos@@ ture , the cl@@ en@@ ched pos@@ ture , and looks inside the mirror . And what does he experience ?
He looks at the ph@@ an@@ tom being res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted , because he &apos;s looking at the refl@@ ection of the normal arm in the mirror , and it looks like this ph@@ an@@ tom has been res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; now , look , w@@ ig@@ gle your ph@@ an@@ tom — your real fingers , or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to get the visual impression that the ph@@ an@@ tom is moving , right ?
That &apos;s obvious , but the astonishing thing is , the patient then says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again , and the pain , the cl@@ en@@ ching sp@@ as@@ m , is reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; And remember , my first patient who came in — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient came in , and he looked in the mirror , and I said , &quot; &quot; Look at your refl@@ ection of your ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; And he started gig@@ gl@@ ing , he says , &quot; &quot; I can see my ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; But he &apos;s not stupid . He knows it &apos;s not real .
He knows it &apos;s a mirror refl@@ ection , but it &apos;s a vivi@@ d sensory experience .
Now , I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand and ph@@ an@@ tom . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I can &apos;t move my ph@@ an@@ tom . You know that . It &apos;s painful . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ve your normal hand . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my ph@@ an@@ tom is moving again . I don &apos;t believe this !
And my pain is being reli@@ ev@@ ed . &quot; &quot; OK ?
And then I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ lose your eyes . &quot; &quot; He clo@@ ses his eyes .
&quot; And move your normal hand . &quot;
&quot; Oh , nothing . It &apos;s cl@@ en@@ ched again . &quot;
&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
So , he was like a kid in a cand@@ y store .
So , I said , OK , this pro@@ ves my theory about learned paraly@@ sis and the critical role of visual input , but I &apos;m not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his ph@@ an@@ tom limb .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a completely us@@ eless ability , if you think about it . ( Laughter )
But then I started realizing , maybe other kinds of paraly@@ sis that you see in neuro@@ logy , like stroke , foc@@ al dy@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ as — there may be a learned component to this , which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror .
So , I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek &quot; &quot; — well , first of all , the guy can &apos;t just go around carrying a mirror to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate his pain — I said , &quot; &quot; Look , Derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
Maybe , after a period of practice , you can dis@@ pense with the mirror , un@@ learn the paraly@@ sis , and start moving your paraly@@ zed arm , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pain . &quot; &quot; So he said OK , and he took it home .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look , it &apos;s , after all , two dollars . Take it home . &quot; &quot; So , he took it home , and after two weeks , he phones me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Doc@@ tor , you &apos;re not going to believe this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot; &quot; I thought maybe the mirror box was gone .
( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , you know this ph@@ an@@ tom I &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
It &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; And I said — I got worried , I said , my God , I mean I &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , eth@@ ics and all of that ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; Derek , does this bo@@ ther you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , last three days , I &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom arm and therefore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ bow pain , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom fore@@ arm pain , all those p@@ ains are gone away .
But the problem is I still have my ph@@ an@@ tom fingers d@@ ang@@ ling from the shoulder , and your box doesn &apos;t reach . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; So , can you change the design and put it on my fore@@ head , so I can , you know , do this and elim@@ inate my ph@@ an@@ tom fingers ? &quot; &quot; He thought I was some kind of mag@@ ician .
Now , why does this happen ?
It &apos;s because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict .
It &apos;s getting messages from vision saying the ph@@ an@@ tom is back .
On the other hand , there &apos;s no propri@@ o@@ cep@@ tion , muscle signals saying that there is no arm , right ?
And your motor command saying there is an arm , and , because of this conflict , the brain says , to hell with it , there is no ph@@ an@@ tom , there is no arm , right ?
It goes into a sort of den@@ ial — it g@@ ates the signals .
And when the arm dis@@ appears , the bon@@ us is , the pain dis@@ appears because you can &apos;t have dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died pain floating out there , in space .
So , that &apos;s the bon@@ us .
Now , this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Hel@@ sin@@ ki , so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for ph@@ an@@ tom pain , and indeed , people have tried it for stroke re@@ habil@@ itation .
S@@ tro@@ ke you normally think of as damage to the fibers , nothing you can do about it .
But , it turns out some component of stroke paraly@@ sis is also learned paraly@@ sis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mir@@ rors .
This has also gone through clinical trials , helping lots and lots of patients .
OK , let me switch g@@ ears now to the third part of my talk , which is about another curious phenomenon called syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
This was discovered by Franc@@ is Gal@@ ton in the nin@@ et@@ e@@ ent@@ h century .
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin .
He pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following pec@@ uli@@ arity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colo@@ red .
Five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , nine is indi@@ go , OK ?
B@@ ear in mind , these people are completely normal in other resp@@ ects .
Or C shar@@ p — sometimes , t@@ ones ev@@ oke color .
C shar@@ p is blue , F shar@@ p is green , another tone might be yellow , right ?
Why does this happen ?
This is called syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia . Gal@@ ton called it syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia , a min@@ gl@@ ing of the senses .
In us , all the senses are distinct .
These people mu@@ dd@@ le up their senses .
Why does this happen ?
One of the two aspects of this problem are very intrigu@@ ing .
Sy@@ nes@@ thes@@ ia runs in families , so Gal@@ ton said this is a her@@ edit@@ ary basis , a genetic basis .
Second@@ ly , syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia is about — and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture , which is about creativity — syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia is eight times more common among artists , po@@ ets , nov@@ el@@ ists and other creative people than in the general population .
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been answered before .
OK , what is syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ? What causes it ?
Well , there are many theories .
One theory is they &apos;re just crazy .
Now , that &apos;s not really a scientific theory , so we can forget about it .
Another theory is they are ac@@ id jun@@ k@@ ies and po@@ the@@ ads , right ?
Now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the Bay A@@ re@@ a than in San Diego .
( Laughter ) OK . Now , the third theory is that — well , let &apos;s ask ourselves what &apos;s really going on in syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia . All right ?
So , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us .
So we said , there &apos;s some accident@@ al cross w@@ iring between color and numbers in the brain .
So , every time you see a number , you see a correspon@@ ding color , and that &apos;s why you get syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
Now remember — why does this happen ?
Why would there be cross@@ ed wires in some people ?
Remember I said it runs in families ?
That gives you the clu@@ e .
And that is , there is an ab@@ normal gene , a mutation in the gene that causes this ab@@ normal cross w@@ iring .
In all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
So , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are tr@@ imm@@ ed down to create the character@@ istic mod@@ ular architecture of the adult brain .
So , if there &apos;s a gene causing this tr@@ imming and if that gene mu@@ tat@@ es , then you get de@@ fici@@ ent tr@@ imming between ad@@ jac@@ ent brain areas .
And if it &apos;s between number and color , you get num@@ ber@@ -@@ color syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
If it &apos;s between tone and color , you get ton@@ e-@@ color syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
So far , so good .
Now , what if this gene is ex@@ pressed everywhere in the brain , so everything is cross-@@ connected ?
Well , think about what artists , nov@@ el@@ ists and po@@ ets have in common , the ability to engage in met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking , lin@@ king seem@@ ingly un@@ related ideas , such as , &quot; &quot; It is the east , and Juli@@ et is the Sun . &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t say , Juli@@ et is the sun , does that mean she &apos;s a glo@@ wing ball of fire ?
I mean , schizoph@@ ren@@ ics do that , but it &apos;s a different story , right ?
Nor@@ mal people say , she &apos;s warm like the sun , she &apos;s radi@@ ant like the sun , she &apos;s nur@@ tur@@ ing like the sun .
Inst@@ antly , you &apos;ve found the links .
Now , if you assume that this greater cross w@@ iring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain , then it &apos;s going to create a greater pro@@ pens@@ ity towards met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical thinking and creativity in people with syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
And , h@@ ence , the eight times more common incidence of syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia among po@@ ets , artists and nov@@ el@@ ists .
OK , it &apos;s a very ph@@ ren@@ ological view of syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
The last demonstration — can I take one minute ?
( Applause ) OK . I &apos;m going to show you that you &apos;re all syn@@ es@@ the@@ tes , but you &apos;re in den@@ ial about it .
Here &apos;s what I call Marti@@ an alphabet . Just like your alphabet , A is A , B is B , C is C.
Di@@ ff@@ er@@ ent shapes for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?
Here , you &apos;ve got Marti@@ an alphabet .
One of them is Ki@@ ki , one of them is Bou@@ ba .
Which one is Ki@@ ki and which one is Bou@@ ba ?
How many of you think that &apos;s Ki@@ ki and that &apos;s Bou@@ ba ? R@@ aise your hands .
Well , it &apos;s one or two mu@@ tants .
( Laughter ) How many of you think that &apos;s Bou@@ ba , that &apos;s Ki@@ ki ? R@@ aise your hands .
N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of you .
Now , none of you is a Marti@@ an . How did you do that ?
It &apos;s because you &apos;re all doing a cross-@@ model syn@@ es@@ thetic abstr@@ action , meaning you &apos;re saying that that shar@@ p infl@@ ection — ki@@ -@@ ki , in your audit@@ ory cortex , the hair cells being excited — Ki@@ ki , mim@@ ics the visual infl@@ ection , sudden infl@@ ection of that j@@ ag@@ ged shape .
Now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive — it &apos;s just — it looks like a silly illusion , but these phot@@ ons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the audit@@ ory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common den@@ omin@@ ator .
It &apos;s a primitive form of abstr@@ action , and we now know this happens in the fu@@ si@@ form gy@@ r@@ us of the brain , because when that &apos;s dam@@ aged , these people lose the ability to engage in Bou@@ ba Ki@@ ki , but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor .
If you ask this guy , what — &quot; &quot; all that g@@ lit@@ ters is not gold , &quot; &quot; what does that mean ? &quot; &quot; The patient says , &quot; &quot; Well , if it &apos;s met@@ alli@@ c and sh@@ in@@ y , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot; &quot; So , they completely miss the met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical meaning .
So , this area is about eight times the size in higher — especially in humans — as in lower primates .
Something very interesting is going on here in the ang@@ ular gy@@ r@@ us , because it &apos;s the cross@@ roads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . And something very interesting is going on .
And I think it &apos;s a basis of many uni@@ quel@@ y human abilities like abstr@@ action , metaphor and creativity .
All of these questions that philosoph@@ ers have been studying for mill@@ en@@ nia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sorry about that .
( Laughter )
This story is about taking imagination seriously .
F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I first encoun@@ tered this ordinary material , fish@@ net , used the same way for centuries .
Today , I &apos;m using it to create permanent , bil@@ lowing , volu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous forms the scale of har@@ d-@@ ed@@ ged buildings in cities around the world .
I was an unlikely person to be doing this .
I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rej@@ ected by all seven .
I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a F@@ ul@@ bright to India .
P@@ rom@@ ising to give exhi@@ bi@@ tions of paintings , I shi@@ pped my pain@@ ts and arrived in Ma@@ hab@@ ali@@ pu@@ ram .
The dea@@ d@@ line for the show arrived — my pain@@ ts didn &apos;t .
I had to do something .
This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
So I tried bron@@ ze cas@@ ting .
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fish@@ er@@ men bun@@ dle their nets into m@@ ounds on the sand .
I &apos;d seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently — a new approach to sculpture , a way to make vol@@ um@@ e@@ tric form without heavy solid materials .
My first satis@@ fying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fish@@ er@@ men .
It &apos;s a self-@@ portrait ti@@ tled &quot; &quot; W@@ ide Hi@@ ps . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We ho@@ isted them on po@@ les to photograph .
I discovered their soft surfaces reve@@ aled every ri@@ p@@ ple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
I was mes@@ mer@@ ized .
I continued studying craft traditions and collabor@@ ating with arti@@ sans , next in Li@@ thu@@ an@@ ia with l@@ ace makers .
I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger — to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
Re@@ turning to India to work with those fish@@ er@@ men , we made a net of a million and a half hand@@ -@@ tied kn@@ ots — install@@ ed briefly in Mad@@ rid .
Th@@ ou@@ sands of people saw it , and one of them was the urban@@ ist Man@@ u@@ al Sol@@ a-@@ Mor@@ ales who was re@@ designing the water@@ front in Por@@ to , Portu@@ gal .
He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
I didn &apos;t know if I could do that and preser@@ ve my art .
Dur@@ able , engineered , permanent — those are in opposition to idi@@ o@@ syn@@ cratic , del@@ ic@@ ate and e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al .
For two years , I search@@ ed for a fiber that could survive ultravi@@ olet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move flu@@ id@@ ly in the wind .
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
So we raised this 4@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000-@@ pound steel ring .
We had to engineer it to move gr@@ ace@@ fully in an average bre@@ e@@ ze and survive in hur@@ r@@ ic@@ ane win@@ ds .
But there was no engineering software to model something por@@ ous and moving .
I found a brilliant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engineer who designs s@@ ails for America &apos;s C@@ up rac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts named Peter He@@ p@@ pel .
He helped me tackle the tw@@ in challenges of precise shape and gent@@ le movement .
I couldn &apos;t build this the way I knew because hand@@ -@@ tied kn@@ ots weren &apos;t going to with@@ stand a hur@@ r@@ ic@@ ane .
So I developed a relationship with an industrial fish@@ net factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make l@@ ace with them .
There was no language to translate this ancient , idi@@ o@@ syn@@ cratic hand@@ craft into something machine oper@@ ators could produce .
So we had to create one .
Three years and two children later , we raised this 5@@ 0,@@ 000-@@ squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ foot l@@ ace net .
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in trans@@ lation .
( Applause ) This intersection had been bl@@ and and anony@@ mous .
Now it had a sense of place .
I walked underneath it for the first time .
As I watched the wind &apos;s cho@@ re@@ ography un@@ fold , I felt shel@@ tered and , at the same time , connected to limit@@ less sky .
My life was not going to be the same .
I want to create these o@@ ases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
I &apos;m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
H@@ ist@@ or@@ ic Philadelph@@ ia City Hall : its pl@@ aza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was ligh@@ ter than n@@ etting .
So we experim@@ ented with tiny atom@@ ized water particles to create a dry mis@@ t that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting w@@ et .
I &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the pa@@ ths of subway trains above ground in real time — like an X-ray of the city &apos;s circul@@ atory system un@@ fol@@ ding .
Next challenge , the Bi@@ enni@@ al of the Amer@@ ic@@ as in Den@@ ver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere and their inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness in a sculpture ?
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know where to begin , but I said yes .
I read about the recent earthquake in Chi@@ le and the tsunami that ri@@ ppl@@ ed across the entire Pacific Ocean .
It shif@@ ted the Earth &apos;s t@@ ect@@ onic pl@@ ates , sp@@ ed up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shor@@ ten@@ ed the length of the day .
So I cont@@ acted N@@ O@@ AA , and I asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
I@@ ts title : &quot; &quot; 1.@@ 26 &quot; &quot; ref@@ ers to the number of micro@@ seconds that the Earth &apos;s day was shor@@ ten@@ ed .
I couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way I knew .
I@@ ts shape was too complex now .
So I replaced the metal ar@@ mature with a soft , fine mes@@ h of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings — literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
There was no software that could ex@@ tru@@ de these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
So we had to create it .
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High L@@ ine .
This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of sky@@ scr@@ apers .
They don &apos;t have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they &apos;re most needed .
F@@ our@@ te@@ en years ago , I search@@ ed for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
Now I combine them with hi@@ -@@ tech materials and engineering to create volu@@ p@@ tu@@ ous , bil@@ lowing forms the scale of buildings .
My artistic horiz@@ ons continue to grow .
I &apos;ll leave you with this story .
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix .
An att@@ or@@ ney in the office who &apos;d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , drag@@ ged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
There they were in their business su@@ its , l@@ aying in the grass , notic@@ ing the changing patterns of wind bes@@ ide people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the re@@ discovery of wonder .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizon@@ tal axis .
After pu@@ ber@@ ty , we fall off the map .
She &apos;s a six@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .

So when I was a kid ...
So it makes sense that we &apos;ve headed in this direction .
So let &apos;s look though at the four choices we are making right now .
Many people don &apos;t know this but tuna are warm@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded .
There are over 3,000 dam@@ s in the state of Conn@@ ec@@ tic@@ ut .
I essentially became an inf@@ ant in a woman &apos;s body .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two h@@ emis@@ pher@@ es are completely separate from one another .
Ex@@ cuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
In@@ formation , in the form of energy , stre@@ ams in simul@@ taneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explo@@ des into this enormous coll@@ age of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment sm@@ ells like and tas@@ tes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
I am an ener@@ gy@@ -@@ being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere .
And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
My left h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere , our left h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere , is a very different place .
Our left h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere thinks lin@@ early and metho@@ dic@@ ally .
And our left h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere thinks in language .
And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
And I felt ligh@@ ter in my body .
